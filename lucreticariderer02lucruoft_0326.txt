longer: or else a new sun is always born, and in successive parts of the
year his fires collect more or less quickly and so rise in particular quar-
terS.—Again three courses are open to your choice, the first most
resembling the theory of vulgar philosophers. 681 cum sumant: see
n. to 111 736 Cum subeant. 682 sol idem, as 658. 683 amfracti-
bus: this word is used by Cicero more than once for the annual course
of the sun 3 see Forc.: but Lucr. here employs it for the unequal daily
curves it makes above and below the horizon. 686 relatus: if the
other part is from east to west, relatus expresses the return from west to
east. 687 anni Nodus must here mean the intersection of the ecliptic
and equator at the two equinoxes‚ though ‘nodus in astronomical Latin
and σύνδεσμος in Greek have also other meanings: Cic. Arat. 287 In

et utrimque redactum. Cic. in his Aratea often has aurae aquilonis,
austri, and the like to denote the point from which the wind blows, as
Lucr. here uses flatus: 280 a clm-isonis auris aquilonis ad austrum Ce-
dens, 272 ab iufervzis austri convertitur auris, 253 Quorum alter tanqem
aquilonis vertitur auras: Lucr. has probably taken the notion from him.
XVhen the sun is midway between the two solstiees‚ the heaven Distinet
aeq. discr. metas: 617 Cancri metas solstitiales was the tropic of cancer 3
and it would be natural therefore to take metas here for the two tropics,
as editors have generally done. But the sentence is then a sheer truism,
when the sun is midway between the tropics he is mid way between them.
Lucr. has been speaking of the inequality of day and night and. account-
ing for it by the path of the sun, imparibus currens amfractibus, in pafr-
tis non aequas dividit orbem, until anni Noclzts nocturnas exaequat lucibus
umbras: here too I take him to be speaking of the daily revolution of
the sun, when day and night are equal. metas can of course be used for
the points where he rises and sets 3 as Ovid met. 111 145 Et sol ex aequo

keeps his two goals, the points where he rises and sets, at an equal dis-
tance from north and south, i.e. speaking roughly he rises and sets due
east and west: 683 we had amfractibus for the diurnal course, which
Cicero 11888, as was said, for the annual. 690 aequato disson: he no
longer in partis uon aequas dividit orbem. 691 siqu. orbis: Cic. Arat.
