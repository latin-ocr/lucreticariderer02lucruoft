niqramque alte subiectat harenam with a quite different application.
701 crateres gives a lively picture of the thing, which neither fauces nor
ora does.

'703 —7112 in the case of many things you must state several causes,
to be sure of including the actual cause: for instance if you see a dead
body at some distance, you may have to suggest this and that cause,
though you are sure only one has occasioned the death—Such an intro-
duction to a series of cases which admit of more than one explanation is,
as has often been remarked above and as may be seen in Epicurus’ letter
to PythocleS‚ very characteristical of this philosophy: τὸ δὲ μίαν αἰτίαν
τούτων ἀποδιδόναι, πλεοναχῶς τῶν φαινομένων ἐκκαλουμένων, μανικόν κ.τ.λ.
says Epic. 1. 1. 113. '704 satis est can hardly in sense apply to pluris:
opus est or the like seems to be required. una tamen sit i.e. causa,
though you are not able to determine it. 707 una, compared with
704 und, appears to be the adjective: ut dicatur una causa leti illius
hominis: the ellipse is harsh anyhow, and it might be simpler to take nna
as the adverb, ‘that among these various causes the cause of his death
may be stated’. '710 yenere ea: hoe, the whole class of causes of death.

712—737: the Nile may rise from various causes: from the etesian
winds blowing up the stream and stopping the waters; or from sand
accumulating at the mouth; 01· perhaps rather from the rains at its
source caused by these winds collecting the clouds there against the high
mountains3 or from snow melting on the lofty Ethiopian hills. '712
