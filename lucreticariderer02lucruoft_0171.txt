process of change or a sort of birth, I answer, birth and change both
imply a previous union: before the creature is begotten, its body cannot
have sense, as its matter is dispersed abroad and has not come together
in a way to awake any of the semes—This passage is obscure: he must
‘apparently be alluding to the stoies: Plut. de stoic. repugn. 41, of Chry-
Sippus, τὸ βρέφος ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ φύσει τρέφεσθαι νομίζει, καθάπερ φύτον·
ὅταν δὲ τεχθῇ ψυχούμενον 13πό τοῦ οἶέρος καὶ στομούμενον τὸ πνεῦμα μεταβάλ-
λειν καὶ γίνεσθαι ζῶον κ.τ.λ.; now this certainly might be termed a
process of change or the effect of a sort of birth 3 life being the immediate
consequence of the birth3 but Lucr. is brief and obscure as he is doubt-
less alluding to writings not extant. 931 dumtaxat: see 11. to 123.
mutabilitate, in the unusual sense of actual change: the primary meaning
is that in which Cicero uses it, tendency to change. oriri Posse a non

that sense can come from what has not sense. [plau. faa: lex. agrar.

so that in both cases there is a union of senseless elements previous to
the recept-ion of sense. 936 3. eone: in the three other passages
where conciliatus occurs, it signifies a union already formed 3 so that
siue conc. appears to me almost synon. with nisi conciliatum3 perhaps
even more significant. 93¹7 Principio ε ‘hic est praecipue (hoc autem

944—962: a living creature receives a blow which its nature cannot
endure: the senses of body and soul are stunned3 the connexion of the
two is broken, and the soul escapes through the apertures of the body:
a blow can do no more than break up and scatter the several elements.
Again the remaining vital motions can often get the better of a less
severe blow, bring each thing back to its proper channel, and rekindle
the senses: in this way only is the thing recalled to life. 950 nodos:
