central animus 3 the anima must have shared with it the other three:
perhaps Epicurus got the notion of this τετάρτη ου’σία or quartessence
from the quintessence of Aristotle. 24¹7 venti here and below takes

gether as to make up a single whole 3 just as in the flesh of any animal
there are different substances, which yet compose a single body: the
fourth nameless substance, the first source of sensation, lurks in the
