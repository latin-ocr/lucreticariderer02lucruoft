BOOK Ι NOTES Π. 31

through the letter he expresses himself, and assumes that Memmius
feels, the greatest contempt for epicurean tenets3 but he says he loves
Atticus as a brother, ‘non quo sit [Atticus] ex istis [epicureis] ; est enim
omni liberali doctrina politissimus 3 sed valde diligit Patronem, valde
Phaedrum amavit'. And surely Lucr. too had much esteemed Patro,
much loved Phaedrus: Id cinerem aut manis credis curare sepultos !
Most readers of this opening address, like the one who of old placed
in the margin of the ms. the six lines from the 2nd book, must have been
struck by its curious contrast with the poet’s philosophical principles.
Bayle in his article on Lucr. n. 1 says it is most reasonable to call it a
‘jeu d'esprit'. Lucr. seeing that all poets invoked the muses at the
beginning of a great work, did not wish to be without a like ornament
and chose Venus as the divinity most suitable to a natural philosopher,
in the same way he invokes Calliope V1 94. There is some plausibility
in this: Calliope we at once feel to be an ordinary personification of the
epic muse: and had Lucretius’ address to Venus had no more depth of
feeling in it than that to Calliope, or other poets' invocations of the
muses, we should have accepted her as a simple impersonation of the
active energy of nature. But the intense earnestness of the language,
the words plain and simple in themselves, yet instinct with life and
passion, make us feel that there is more than this. If the poet began
with such an intention, his headstrong muse has got the better of his
philosophy, and constrained him to follow her guidance. This perhaps
is his best defence‚ if defence be needed: νουθετεῖται μὲν ὑπὸ τῶν πολλῶν
ὥς παρακινῶν ἐνθουσιάζων δὲ λέληθε τούς πολλούς. Montaigne, essais 111
5, has well perceived the characteristic features of this address. He
quotes the latter part of it and then compares it with a fine passage of
the Aeneid, v111 387 foll.; and thus concludes ‘Quand je rumine ce
reicit, pascit, inhians, molli, fovet, medullas, labefacta, pendet, percurrit, et
cette noble circumfusa mere du gentil infusus j’ay desdain de ces menue‘s
pointes et allusions verbales qui nasquirent depuis'. How tame even
Spenser's elegant paraphrase and Dryden’s translation are by the side of
the original. Lamb. cites with approbation P. Victorius who argues
from Plut. adv. Col. and Cic. de nat. deor. 1 45, that Epic. did not forbid
sacrifice and prayer to the gods 3 ‘habet enim' says Velleius ‘venera-
tionem iustam quidquid excellit'3 but he adds that Lucr. prays here not
as a philosopher, but as a poet. The stoic Cleanthes’ hymn to Jupiter is
conceived in much the same spirit: he addi-esses the god as Ζεῦ φύσεως
σῖρχηγέ, whom all mortals should address, Ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ γένος ἐσμέν.
Many motives doubtless were acting at once on the poet's mind.
Venus was symbol of the all-pervading living force of nature ς she was
legendary mother of the Romans: Mars ruled the first, she the second
mouth of spring and the year. Mars indeed in the old Italian mythology
was the youthful and beneficent god of plenty, father of the Latin moes:
