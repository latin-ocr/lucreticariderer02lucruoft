Ι 2 IN'PRODUCTION

The Lucretian hexameter occupies an important place in the history
of Latin poetry, coming as it does between that of Ennius who invented
and that of Virgil who brought this metre to perfection. What Ennius
did in this matter is a curicus study: he not only was the first to intro-
duce this new and strange form of verse into the language on which it
was to continue to exercise so great an influence ever after 3 but he laid
down for it laws of prosody differing in many essential points from those
observed by himself in his tragedies as well as by all the other tragic
and comic poets of his own and the following age. These laws, trans-
mitted from one generation to another, taught as a necessary part of a
liberal education and enforced on the writers of elegiac and lyrical as
well as of heroic verse, had no doubt a large share in fixing for many
centuries the outward form and inner nature of the language, the
tendency of which, as of its cognate dialects Oscan Umbrian and the
like, was towards rapid change, though perhaps in the end they caused
it to come down with a heavier crash, when at last the gulf between it
and the debased and degraded speech of the people became too immense.
The history of Attic and vulgar Greek is very similar. Complete how-
ever as Ennius’ system of quantity was, quite as complete as that of
Virgil, his rhythm from the nature of the case was somewhat rude and
uncouth 3 he attempted to imitate the Greek structure of verse in points
where there appeared to be a natural incompatibility between it and the
Latin. There is not evidence to shew by what steps this rhythm was
gradually improved, until at length in the hands of Virgil it attained
that elaborate and complicated yet exquisite perfectiori, which is utterly
different from the Homeric movement, and yet appears as well adapted
to the Latin forms of speech as the other is to the Ionic. We have
however sufficient proof that Lucretius gave to the form of his verse as
well as to his language an antique colouring, as if he wished in this
respect too to break with his contemporaries and approach to the manner
of Ennius. He is however a far more finished master of versification
than Ennius, and his most striking violations of the laws of construction
habitually observed by his contemporaries or immediate predecessors
often produce very fine and harmonicus effects. That he is more archaic
in these respects than his age may be proved not only by a comparison
between him and Catullus, but by taking note of the laws of metre
observed by Cicero in his youthful hexameters, which he must therefore
have learnt from his teachers. Let us examine briefly some of the lead-
ing differences between the verse of Lucretius and that of Virgil and
certain other authors. In the Latin and Greek hexameter alike the
rhythm mainly depends on the caesura. The due observance of this
caesura together with a manifold variety in the fiow of the verse forms
the great charm both of the Greek and the Latin heroic 3 and examples
of its violation are exceedingly rare in Homer Lucretius and Virgil
