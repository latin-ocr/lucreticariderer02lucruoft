, of the language was more and more to discard them, until barbarous

writers like Tertullian forced it back in the opposite direction. Lu-
cretius in VI 129 uses perterricrepus: this word Cicero in one of his
latest works the orator, 164, quotes from an old poet and condemns for
‘ asperitas', as well as versutiloquus. Now these two adjectives are
formed quite regularly3 and so are the repandiroscrum incurvicervicum
of Pacuvius 3 but Quintilian, who in his instit. 1 6 65-70 states the
limits within which the Latin of his day might form compounds,
observes ⁶ cum κυρταύχενα mirati sumus, incurvicervicum vix a risu
defendimus'. See also Livy quoted in n. to V 839. The right of form-
ing compound nouns and verbs by prefixing the different prepositions
always remained in full force3 and no one having his attention called to
this point can read a page of Cicero or Livy without feeling what an
influence over style and expression this usage of the language exercised,
an influence almost equally apparent in any page of an English or
French writer.

Standing as Lucretius did entirely aloof from what would most excite
the sympathies of his contemporaries, there is not much evidence to shew
what reception hispoem met with from the great mass of his country—
men. It sufficiently appears however that he and Catullus were justly
esteemed the two greatest poets of their age. Yet there can be no doubt
that his work came into the world at a time very unfavourable for the
fame of its author. He would take no part in the great movement then
in active progress which ended in producing the works of Virgil Horace
and Ovid and fixed once and for ever the Roman standard of poetical
taste. The splendour of their reputation threw into the shade that of
their greatest predecessors, Ennius Lucretius and even Catullus: they
obtained the unanimous suffr-ages of the best critics of the empire, at the
head of whom stood Quintilian. The reaction in favour of the older
literature seems to have been headed by unskilful and too zealous
leaders and thus to have exposed itself to the shafts of satire. The effect
which Dryden and Pope produced for some generations on English poetry
gives but a faint notion of the sovereignty exercised by the Augustali
poets. And yet Lucretius had no slight influence on the poetry of
succeeding ages, although the first mention of his verses according to the
interpretation usually given is anything but complimentary. I refer of
course to a sentence of Cicero written a few months after the poet's
death and probably at the very time when his poem was first published.
At the end of a short letter to his brother Quintus, 11 ll, written
early in 700, occurs this sentence as it is given in all mss. Lucretii
poemata ut scribis ita sunt multis luminibus inycnii multae tamen artis.
Nearly all editors are now agreed in writing ica sunt, ozon multis cet. 3
but sense alone must determine the right reading: to put non before
multae tamen <orcis is quite as easy an emendation. What then 15
