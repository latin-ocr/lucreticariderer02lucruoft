recorded 01 his life 3 nor is anything whatever known about his family:
indeed the only other instance I have been able to find 01 the cognomen
Carus attached to the name 01 Lucretius is a very doubtful one occurring
in Momnisen's inser. reg. Neapol. Lat. 1653 ‘ Beneventi in aedibus
archiepiscopi ’. But Prof. Sellar well remarks that literary distinction
at this time was almost confined to the higher classes ; and we need not
infer from the rarity 01 13116 cognomen that he did not belong to an old
family. In this age the cognomen was often varied even in the same
family: the father 01 13116 contemporary poet and orator O. Licinius
Calvus is always called Licinius Macer 3 nay Calvus himself is once so
styled by Cicero ad Q. fratrem 11 41. Lucretius therefore may well
have belonged to the high patriciali gens 01 the Lucretii Tricipitini
whose glories were chiefly linked with the early history 01 the common-
wealth and were doubtless in great measure legendary‚ but not the less
valued perhaps on that account. Though Lucius Publius and Spurius
are more common among the Tricipitini, and a Hostus is named by Val.
Maximus, yet a T. Lucretius was consul with P. Valerius in 246, the
second year of the commonwealth, and again in 250 with the same
colleague 3 Titus too was the name 01 the father and grandfather 01
L. Lucretius Tricipitinus who was consul and triumphed over the Aequi
and Volsci in 292. Flavus appears in the fasti consulares as a cogno-
men 01 these Tricipitini. Ofella, Gallus, Trio are attached to other
Lucretii, probably plebeians, but sufficiently illustrious. As Suetonius
took great pains in searching out the best original authorities 101· 311 his
statements, the facts mentioned above, even 11 somewhat coloured, must
be accepted as true in the main, as Lachmann observes, p. 63 ; the more
so that in February 01 the year 700 Cicero writes to his brother Quin-
tus 11 11 the wellrknown sentence Lucretii poemata ut scribis ita sunt
cet. This is the only occasion on which he ever mentions the poet’s
name, and it proves that four months after the death 01 Lucretius he
and his brother Quintus had read the poem which, as we saw in the
introduction to notes 1, could not have been published in the author's
lifetime. Now this seems too short a time for the Ciceros to have read
and to be writing about the work, 11 neither 01 them had had anything
to do with preparing it 101 publication. But to which 01 13116 two
brothers does J erome refer? in Latin or English when Cicero or Oaesar
is mentioned, 11 there is nothing else to determine who is spoken 01, 13116
orator or the dictator is naturally implied3 and J erome in a dozen 01 his
additions to the Eusebian chronicle thus denotes Marcus. But both
Lachmann and Bernays decide that Quintus must be meant: ‘in re nota'
says the former ‘nihil opus fuit ut Ciceronis praenomen poneret, cum
nemo ignoraret Quintum intellegendum esse'. But why it should be a
res noca to Jerome and his contemporaries or even to Suetonius I cannot
see. Harl Jerome found Quintus in his original, he must have added it,
