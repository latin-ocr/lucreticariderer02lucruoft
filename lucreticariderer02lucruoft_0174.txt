991—1022: nay we men, as well as beasts and the fruits of the earth,
may be said to have our birth from heaven as father, and earth who as
mother gives us food and therefore life: death too is but the going back
of our elements to heaven and earth respectively: then in a moment all
forms and colours and senses perish, which depend on the motions
arrangements 616. of first-beginnings3 even as in this our poem a few
letters produce by different arrangements, etc. quite different verses.—
The first part of this passage is a literal translation of a fragment from
the Chrysippus of Anaxagoras' scholar Euripides, Γαῖα μεγίστη καὶ Διὸς
αἰθήρ, Ὁ μὲν ἀνθρώπων καὶ θεῶν γενέτωρ, ‘H δ’ ὖγροβόλους σταγόνας
νοτίας Παραδεξαμένη τίκτει θνητούς, Τίκτει δὲ βορὰν φῦλά τε θηρῶν, Ὅθεν
οὐκ ἀδίκως Μήτηρ πάντων νενόμισται. Χωρεῖ δ’ ὀπίσω Τὰ μὲν ἐκ γαίας

ἄλλου Μορφήν ἑτέραν ἅπέδειξεῑ ib is translated by Vitruvius too ab the
beginning of his 8th book: Euripides auditor Anaxaqorae, quem philo-
sophum Athenienses scaenicum appellaverunt, aera et terram eamque e
caelestium imbrium conceptionibus inseminatam fetus ,qentium et omnium
animalium in mundo procreavisse, and so on: comp. 1 250 and what is
said in illustration of that similar passage about the antiquity of the
doctrine that heaven is the father and earth the mother of all things.
Arist. de plantis 1 2 p. 817 27 expressly states that Anaxagoras taught
ὅτι ἦ γῆ μήτηρ μέν ἐστι τῶν φυτῶν, ὁ δὲ ἥλιος πατήρτ Euripides re-
peats the same sentiment in a fragment of the Melanippe worth compar-
ing. The whole of our passage is quite epicurean and consistent with
the general argument of Lucr. though his fondness for Euripides has
made him express himself in the language of Anaxagoras3 with whom
however as we have shewn in the first book he and Epicurus had many
points of contact, points which are well brought out here. What
