been surpassed in modern times as Latin scholars and Latin writers, and
both moreover studied Lucretius with unwearied diligence: the former
who edited Plautus Cicero and Horace as well as Lucretius pronounces
hizn to be ‘omnium poetarum Latinorum qui hodie exstant et qui ad
nostram aetatem pervenerunt elegantissimus et purissimus idemque
gravissimus atque ornatissimus’ 3 and in another place he tells Charles lx
that the style of Cicero or Caesar is not purer than this poet's: the latter
is never weary of extolling his ‘sermonis castitas⁷, his ‘lactea ubertas'
and the like. It is in the style and structure of his language that this
purity is observable: in single words he has by no means obeyed the
emphatic adjuration of his great contemporary to shun like a rock a new
and unusual term ; but has taken a poet's privilege to coin hundreds of
new words which have been pointed out where they occur and to intro-
duce not a few from the Greek. And here will be the place to make
some remarks on the poet’s own coxnplaint of the poverty of his native
tongue. We may first assert as an indisputable fact that in his day the
living Latin for all the higher forms of composition both prose and verse
was a far nobler language than the living Greek. Let not what is said
be misunderstood. During the long period of Grecian preeminence and
literary glory‚ from Homer to Demosthenes, all the manifold forms of
poetry and prose which were invented one after the other, were brought
to such an exquisite perfection, that their beauty of form and grace of
language were never afterwards rivalled by Latius or any other people.
But hardly had Demosthenes and Aristotle ceased to live, when that
Attic which had been gradually formed into such a noble instrument of
thought in the hands of Aristophanes Euripides Plato and the orators
and had superseded for general use all the other dialects‚ became at the
same time the language of the civilised world and was stricken with a
mortal decay. It seems to have been too subtle and delicate for any but
its wonderful creators. The Alexandrine poets who imitated earlier
styles, and even the graceful Theocritus repeat parrot-like forms which
they do not understand, because their meaning had been lost for cen-
turies. If what is said of a Theocritus be thought presumptuous‚ there
is no question that it is true of prose writers. Epicurus who was born
in the same year as Menander writes a harsh jargon that does not
deserve to be called a style3 and others, of whose writings anything is
left entire or in fragments, historians and philosophers alike, Polybius
Chrysippus Philodemus, are little if at all better. When Cicero deigns
to translate any of their sentences, see what grace and life he instils into
their clumsily expressed thoughts ! how satisfying to the ear and taste
are the periods of Livy when he is putting into Latin the heavy and un-
couth clauses of Polybius! This may explain what Cicero means, when
at one time he gives to Greek the preference over Latin, at another to
Latin over Greek: in reading Sophocles or Plato he would acknowledge
