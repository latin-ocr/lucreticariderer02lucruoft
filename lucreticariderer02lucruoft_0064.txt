clothes without being seen: metals stones wear away 3 things grow, and
decay, as rocks from seabrine3 yet the process of growth and decay is
unseen in all. 265 Nunc aye, a not unfrequent formula in Lucr. by
which he bids his reader to give heed, when he is passing to a new ques-
tion: it is used more than once in the same way by Virgil, and often by
Manilius: Cicero has aye nunc: comp. too Empedocles 248 Karsten Νῦν
δ’ ἄγ’ ὅπως...τῶνδε κλύε and 182 Εἰ δ’ ἆγε, νῦν τοι ἐγώ λέξω, and 101 Ἀλλ’
ἄγε μύθων κλῦθι, and 124. 270 videriz268 cerni: a sense common in
Lucr.‚ not very unusual in Cicer03 as de off. 111 38 ibi cum palam
eius anuli acl palmam converterat, α nullo videbatur, ipse autem omnia
videbat 3 idem rursus videbatur, cum in locum anulum inverterat: ib. 1

271 portus: the wind beats against them and prevents all ingress to
ships3 rendering them therefore more dangerous than the open sea.
This so careful an observer as Lucr. would doubtless understand. [Elgin
Com-ant, Dec. 22 1876; ‘the steamer Tyne entering Shields harbour
yesterday went ashore. All hands were lost...More shipping disasters
are reported from Shields. The steamship Blenheim of Hartlepool, in
entering the harbour, went against the end of the south pier and after-
wards broke in two. Afterwards the ste-amer New Cornwall of Barn-
staple‚ making for the harbour was overwhehned by the sea and foundered,
all hands being lost'.] 272 ruit used 289 and 292 in same sense:
Plautus and Terence appear each to use it once and only once actively 3
Virgil more frequently. Virg. geor. 111 197 has arida differt Nubila.

305 fluctifraqo: Lucr. seems the only classic who uses these words,
which are both active. perfurit Cum frem. saev. muron. a striking
tautology 3 unless indeed, as I sometimes think, the pontus of mss, can
be defended, saevit—pontus being a clause apart and finishing the
comparison in a way so often followed by Virgi13 as geor. 1. 334 Nunc
nemora inqenti vento, nunc litora planyunt‚ which may indeed be a
reminiscence of Lucu: comp. too Hor. epod. 13 2 nunc mare, nunc
siluae Threicio Aquilone sonant. cum fremitu or fremitu, murmure
or cum murmure, all equally Latin: IV 539 cum summost clamore pro-
