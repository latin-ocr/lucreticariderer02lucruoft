ment of 1v 823-857, where the doctrine of final causes in respect of
the bodily organs is so earnestly denied. On these and similar sections
of the poem see what is said above p. 28-30, where I attempt to carry
Lachmann's argument somewhat farther. Some vss. as is said in notes 1,
are clearly wanting before 165 : whether they ever existed in the poem
and were not rather lost before it came into the first editor's hands, we
may well doubt with Lach. The way in which the latter supplies the
meaning of what is wanting, seems to me however somewhat awkward:
I should be disposed to make the gods the subject to persectari and
videant, and to take the reasoning to be something like that in Cic. de
div. 11 105 foll. where it is said περανῶ id esse alienum maiestate deorum.
scilicet causas omnium introspicere, ut videant quid cuique conducat.
You must not suppose that the gods have anything to do with the
motions and unions of these atoms : nay it would not be even consistent
with their majesty and happiness to be tormenting themselves with all
these minutiae, ‘and to be following up the course of every single atom
to see how everything goes on'.

165 persectari recurs 1v lOlO, and appears to be peculiar to Lucr.
167 quidam: the stoics are doubtless pointed at, perhaps also the aca-
demics. 169 admoderate seems also peculiar to Lucu: Gronov.
observ. 111 5 compares the attemperate of Ter. Andr. 916 which has pre-
cisely the same sense. 171 Et iam cetera appears to be used almost
absolutely, as cetera, et cetera are in so many ways: fleri or ‘naturam
facere riou posse may be understood from the context. 1¹72 173 these
two vss. are connected with the relative clause, as 141 and some of the
instances given in n. to 1 718. 172 deducit : metaphor from leading
the bride to her husband ε comp. 1 96 Deductast and n. there. 173

he compares Vitruv. pref. to 111: but comp. too Livy XXI 1 4 Hanniba-

175 omnibu' rebus is so used by Cicero, as div. in Caec. 61 tu, cum omni—
bus rebus inferior sis, liae uma iu re cet. eqo, si superior omnibus rebus
esses, hanc unam ob causam cet.3 similarly 111 1026 Qui melior multis
quam tu fuit, improbe, rebus. 177--181 recur, slightly altered, V

partim stant ε perhaps Lucr. was thinking of Lucilius' stat sentibu’ pectus,
and stat sentibu’ fundus 3 as Virgil, Horace, and Ovid possibly, when
they wrote stat pulvere caelum, alta stet nive candidum Soracte, samo stavit
antra vetusto, respectively. [See Nonius p. 392 6 and Sisenna quoted
there, and esp. Varro Eumenid] At all events Caecilius' ayer autem
stet sentibus and Titinius' fundi stabunt sentibus shew that the phrase
was proverbial. Comp. too Aen. 111 210 stant nomine dictae 3 and Lucr.
