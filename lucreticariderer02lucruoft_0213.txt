operam ponendam in eo non arbitrantur 3 and see Madvig's note, and
also his emend. Liv. p. 573 3 where in xmv 25, to answer non tam quia,
he adds in 3 ceterum3 but to me it seems that after a long quasi-paren-
thesis the non tam is answered in 5 by magsis cupiit. 614 uc anquis:
see n. to 456.

615—623: why too is the mind never born in the head or foot, but
in one fixed spot, if not because it is only a part of the body 3 and the
body, like other things has its own fixed organiffin, so that every member
has in it its proper place'l effect ever follows cause, nor can fire arise in
water, frost in fire. 615 animi mens: IV 758 Mens animi vigilat 3

616 unis: 11 159 ipsa, suis e partibus una3 919 una eademque 3 V 897
nec moribus unis. 61¹7 omnibus I now take for the dat. masc. though
it is somewhat harsh. 619 ubi quicquid :ubi quicque: see 11. 10 11
957. 620 mult. partitis artubus esse: comp. 11 909 Aut simili totis
animalibus esse3 and vl 268. 618-621 ‘the constr. seems to be
“reddita sunt cuique certa loca cet.: [redditum est cuique] ubi—crea-
tum '’: then in 620 it may be a question whether esse depends on possit
or is subject of redditum est cuique again. May not cuique and quicquid
be taken not specially for parts of the body, but universallytt There is a
law which appoints to each several thing its place of birth, its place to
abide in, and its existing with such a manifold organisation of joints,
that etc.' J. E. M.-—This paragraph as it stands has very many diffi-
culties: others have seen that there is no very close connexion with
what precedes and follows 3 and that the language much resembles 784—
797. At the same time it cannot be transferred there: the argument
15 far from being the same : there existence of both the soul and the mind
out of the body 15 denied: here the existence of the mind alone anywhere
but in its own proper spot in the body, etc. In my earlier editions,
thinking as I now think that 620 621 must refer to the organised
body, I inferred that cuique and quicquid must refer to parts of the body.
To this Professor Mayor's argument is directed : cuique and quicquid Ι
allow are better taken generally 3 as 7 87 Certum ac dispositumst ubi
quicquit crescat et insit, since the whole of that passage has apparent
reference to our own. As for the constr. of 619 Prof. Mayor's may be
simpler3 but I took it aszcerta loca reddita sunt ubi quicque nascatur
et natum durare possit. I now believe that certainly one v. and proba-
bly two at least are lost after 619 3 and that this might shew the mean·
ing of what is wanting: Certum ae dispositum naturae leqibu' constat.
Hoc fieri nostrum quoque corpus foedere debet, Atque ita cet. 622
