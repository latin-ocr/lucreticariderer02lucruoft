notes that more than once in his philosophical works he must refer
to Lucretius. Had the poet been alive when the de finibus or the
de natura was written, he might have taken the place of Torquatus or
Velleius.

However this may be, it is certain enough that the poem was given
to the world early in the year 700, and in the unfinished state in which
it was left by the author: indeed I hardly like to say how strong my
suspicions, even my convictions are, that many of the most manifest
blunders in the poem as we now have it appeared in the very first edition
of it whether from desi gn or inadvertency: probably both 3 for later in this
very year Cicero writes to his brother in Britain, 111 6 6, that he despairs
of procuring for him accurate copies of Latin writers, ita mendose et
scribantur et venezmt. It is not easy in any other way to explain the
agreement of Macrobius and Nonius with the archetype of all existing
manuscripts in some indisputable corruptions. The story of the poet’s
madness has been examined by Prof. Sellar l. l. p. 200. Whether there
is any truth in it or not, it cannot be doubted that it was already current
in Suetonius' time 3 yet few will deny ‘that it would be strange if so
remarkable a poem had been written in the lucid intervals of insanity'.
This poem was designed to be a complete exposition of the physica]
system of Epicurus, not for the sake of the system itself, but in order to
free the minds of men from the two greatest of all ills, fear of death and
fear of the gods, by explaining to them the true nature of things. So
far he followed in the steps of his master who with the same end in
view composed among many other works one entitled περὶ φύσεως 111 37
books, of which some wretchedly scanty and incomplete fragments have
been published in the Herculanean volumes. How much Lucretius was
indebted to this more important work may be gathered from the letters
of Epicurus preserved in the ‘tenth book of Diogenes Laertius, which
givea brief epitome of his system and have been so largely used in this
commentary. The poet's veneration for his teacher would constrain him
to borrow from him his matter 3 his manner and style are altogether differ-
ent. To Lucretius the truth of his philosophy was all-important: to this
the graces of his poetry were made altogether subordinate. Το us on the
other hand the truth or falsehood of his system is of exceedingly little
concern except in so far as it is thereby rendered a better or worse
vehicle for conveying the beauties of his language and the graces of his
poetical conceptions.

Is then the epicurean system well or ill adapted to these purposes2
As a poet in that age could scarcely be the inventor 'of a new system of
philosophy, Lucretius could hardly help adopting some one of those
which were then in vogue 3 if not the epicurean, then the academical or
peripatetica] or stoical. To construet a poem out of either of the first
two with its barren logomachics‚ wire-drawn distinctions without a
