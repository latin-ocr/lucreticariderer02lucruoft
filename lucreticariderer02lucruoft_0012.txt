4 INTRODUCTION

‘leviter retractavit [Persii librum] Cornutus et Caesio Basso, petenti
ut ipsi cederet, tradidit edendum'. Bassus was Persius' earliest friend:
‘amicos habuit a prima adulescentia Caesium Bassum poetam cet.'
Professor Sellas in his Roman poets of the republie p. 203, though not
inclined to admit the editorship of Cicero, yet argues that J erome must
be speaking of Marcus. A brilliant critic in Macmillan’s magazine,
no. 67 p. 52, calls in question this tradition and finds it difficult to get
over the fact that Lucretius is dismissed by Cicero in a dozen cold
words If however the whole circumstances of the case are examined,
this difficulty will I believe wholly or in great measure disappear.
These dozen words occur in a hurried note to his brother of less than a
dozen lines3 it is the only note addressed to Quintus during the whole
and more than the whole interval between the death of Lucretius and
the publication of his poem. The only other letters written by him
during those months are a few formal dispatches to officials on publio
business, with the exception of one brief hurried note to Atticus written
in November from his Tusculan, to which he had retired for a few days’
relaxation. In this note he gives half a dozen words to his own de
oratore which he tells Atticus is now fit for publication and may at
once be transcribed by his copyists. He did not therefore write to
Atticus or others about Lucretius, because he was in Rome, seeing Atti-
cus daily and, if Lucretius' poem was then in his hands, discussing
doubtless with him and others its merits and condition. I find in
Cicero no such anxiety, as this writer finds, about the phrases of any
friend's essay. The expression ‘inhibere remos' occurred in his own
academics: he had rashly allowed Atticus to substitute it in the‘copies
already made for his own ‘sustinere remos ⁷. WVhen he found out the
true meaning of that nautical expression, he writes in the greatest hurry
and trepidation to try and prevent the solecism going forth to the world,
especially to the archcritic Varro to whom the work was dedicated. The
mere mention then of Lucretius, slight as it is, would seem to indicate of
itself some relation between him and the orator. As remarked on 11
1092, it is not Cicero⁷s custom to quote from contemporaries, numerous
as his citations are from the older poets and himself. Had he written
on poetry, doubtless Lucretius would have had a prominent place in it 3
but even where in his rhetorical works he criticises so fully the orators
of the day, he abstains from quoting their words. In all his writings
the name of Catullus does not once appear, though his poems deal so
much with the topics and names of the day most interesting to Cicero 3
notwithstanding his brilliant compliinent to the orator which must have
been thoroughly felt, his agreement with him in politics, his lampoons
on Caesar and the Caesarians 3 though they both in different ways
suffered so grievously from Clodia or Lesbia the terrible ‘Clytaemnestra
quadrantaria ', the Medea of the Palatine. It has been shewn in our
