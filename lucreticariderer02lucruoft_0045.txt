quinctilis and Quinctilius 3 the old ms. of the last five books of Livy

'73 Epic. is the subject of Processit and peraqravit. flamm.
moen. mundi a noble expression which frequently recurs, to denote the
fiery orb of ether that forms the outer circuit of the world: its nature is
fully described in the fine passage v 457—470, ending with Omnia sic
avido complexu cetera saepsit, imitated in paradise lost 111 721 Tlte rest
iu circuit walls tltis universe: the use of ‘universe' is of course quite
unepicurean. It may be a question whether mumii in this phrase means
the whole world, or is a synonyme, as it so often is, of caelum or aether:
it certainly appears to have 1116 161161 meaning in VI 123, where capacis
well expresses 1116 avidus complemus of ether: 1116 former seems more
poetica] and is confirmed by the imitation in Manilius 1 151 Flammarum
vallo naturae moenia fecit, where naturae clearly denotes the whole world:
this constant imitator of and carper at Lucr. has also 486 moenia mundi
in a passage where he is trying to refute Epicurus and him. '74 an
emphatic oxymoron: he passed beyond this world and traversed in
thought the immeasurable universe: Cic. de fin. 11 102 must surely
have been thinking of this passage when he says ltaec non erant eius qui
innumerabilis mundos infinitasque reqiones quarum nulla esset ora, nulla
extremitas, mente peram-avisset: see Madvig: and Hor. od.1 28 5 animo-

poetical tautology: 111 84 animum dico, mentem quam saepe vocamus3
and all through that book they are synonymes. [Cic. epist. x 5 2
perhaps differentiates the two: ut tota mente omnique animi impetu
iaz rempublicam incumbas] Lucr. more than once too uses mens animi,
as does Catullus after or before him. Virgil was probably thinking
of these words and this rhythm in Aen. V1 11 maynam cui mentem
animumque 3 though the expression is common in prose, and is found
in Cicero, Caesar, Livy and Tacitus '75 Lamb. seems right in
comparing refert victor with Aen. 1v 93 laudem et spolia amffla raeJertis:
where refertis however is simply ‘carry home', as Plaut. Poen. 1v 2 25
domum haec ab aede Veneris refero vasa. At the same time it herc
unites the common and cognate meaning of a messenger or the like
bringing back a report: the two senses I have tried to combine. The
