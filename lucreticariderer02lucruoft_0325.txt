tere, not its usual sense. 653 itere z on the other hand VI 339 itiner:
iteris or itere appears to be used by Naevius Pacuvius Accius Varr03
itiner by Plautus Ennius Pacuvius Accius Manilius I 88.

656—679: daylight returns at stated hours, either because the same
unchanged sun passes under the earth and comes above it again, or
because the fires of a new sun collect every morning at the proper time:
this may well be 3 for many things, such as puberty in man, come at a
certain time 3 and many things such as snow rain ancl lightning return
pretty regularly: so it has been from the beginning and so it continues
to be.—The alternative here allowed is the same as that given in the
preceding passage 3 see Epicurus there cited: the old sun returns, or a
fresh one is born every day. 659 Antieipat governs caelum: comp.

XVII 7 6 gives the same curious story more fully than Luor. 3 as well as
Mela 1 94 and 95: the Trojan Ida is spoken of. The stoic Cleomedes de
subl. 11 87 scoffs at this theory of Epicurus: καίτοι πρὸς ἅπασι τοῖς εἰρημέ-
νοις ἆτοπωτάτοις οὖσι ἔτι καὶ το) ἄστρα ἀπεφήνατο ἀνατέλλοντα μὲν ἐξάπτε-
σθαι, δυόμενα δὲ σβέννυσθαι, and he cleverly remarks that this is like say-
ing that men while they are seen are alive3 as soon as they are out of
sight are dead. 664 orienti: 887 fuqienti l. vita 3 vl 126 Turbine
versanti3 IV 914 Vera repulsanti: the abl. in i is rare, when it is a real
participle 3 common where the partic. is rather an epithet‚ as 1074

rhet. suas. 3 1 Arellius Fuscus says of the moon, splendensque pariter
adsumit in cornua] 676 N on nimis in this sense is common enough
in Cicero. 678 Atque ita cet. is like Epicurus' expression 1. l. 92 κατά
τὴν ἅρχῆθεν ἐν τῇ τοῦ κόσμου γενέσει ἀνάγκην ἀπογεννηθεῖσαν. 679 Con-
seque': comp. n. to 1 560 relicuo, of which the principle is the same3 and
see Lachmann's very learned note: he shews that adsecue' is used more
than once by Plautus: the old writers never contracted the last two
syllables into one in any of these words, any more than in inqenuus
perpetuus ambiyuus and the like.

680—704: days and nights lengthen and shorten time about, either
because the sun continuing the same chooses to run in unequal curves
above and below the horizon, his course above being as much more 01·
less than a· semicircle, as his course below is less or more, until at each
equinox the two are equal: all this you may see marked on a map of
heaven: or else the air is denset· in some parts than in others, so that lie
travels more slowly through the former: and thus the winter nights arc
