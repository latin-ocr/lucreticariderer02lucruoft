κώνειον πιαίνει τοὺς ὄρτυγας, and Lewes 1. l. p. 62 ‘the poisons are food
to many, the rabbit devouring belladonna, the goat hemlock, and the
horse aconite'. For the quantity of coturn„ see 11. to 1 360 and 111 504:
whether the cocturn. of A is the genuine spelling or a corruption, I am
unable to decide: the former is maintained by Fleckeisen, Rhein. mus.
vm p. 232, and Zeyss‚ Philolog. xxxl p. 3093 the latter by Lach. ε which
would seem to be the truth, if we can trust the old grammarians, Caper
p. 2248, and one in Keil's gramm. Lat. v p. 573 ‘coturnicem antiqui
dixerunt, nunc cocturnix'. 643 ante, 1 814, 895 and elsewhere.
647 Eaet. mem. circ. we had above 111 219. 651 ipso refers to ore as
well as palato, they being singled out from the other membra, as those
which have to do with taste: comp. 1044 partis qenitalis corporis ipsas 3
and vl 1175 ipso venientes ore patente. 652 maioraque i.e. quaedam
maiora: comp. n. to 518: foramina is the subject. 654 multanyula
appears to occur in no other writer of a good age. 660 contractabi-
liter too seems a ἅπαξ λεγόμ.τ a, as twice in contractans. 668 corpora
i.e. the levissima of 659. 669 cetera: Aspera nimirum hamataque of
662. 671 Lachmann's note is quite beside the point: he gains no-
thing by transposing these vss.; for, as just shewn, the quae corpora of
668 and the cetera of 669 are the very lei-issima and Α spera respoetively,
for which he makes his transposition. I now incline to rejectalso Bernays'
notion of a lacuna: the mention of honey is somewhat abrupt 3 but that
is explained by the fact that it was proverbial as an illustration of the
merely relative notion of sweet and bitter: thus Sextus pyrrh. hyp. 11 63
ἐκ τοῦ τὸ μέλι τοῖσδε μὲν πικρὸν τοῖσδε δὲ γλυκὺ φαίνεσθαι ὁ μὲν Δημό-
κριτος ἔφη μήτε γλυκὺ αὐτὸ εἶναι μήτε πικρόν, ὁ δὲ εΗροῖκλειτος ἀμφότερα.
Now Lucr. has just specified sever with a flow of bile as the cause of this
change of sweet to bitter: with this comp. Galen de simpl. med. temp. 1v
17 οὐδὲν οῧν θαυμαστὸν οὐδὲ διοὶ τί τὸ γλυκύτατον ἁπάντων μέλι τὸν πικρότα-
τον γεννᾷ, χυμὸν καὶ διοί τί μάλιστα τοῖς ἀκμάζουσί τε καὶ φύσει θερμοῖς
καὶ πυρέττουσιν...ὅταν ἀκραιφνεῖ πλησιάζῃ θερμότητι, τόν χολώδη γεννᾷ
χυμόν; comp. too Sen. epist. 109 7. Lucr. probably gothis illustration

with 111 189-195, from which it will appear that honey has many
smooth round atonis in it whence it gets its usually pleasant flavour 3 but
at the same time it has a constantior natura Et piqri latices mayis et
cunctantior actus than water, and therefore has more rough and hooked
atoms3 so that in peculiar states of the tongue and palate, in fever for
instance, these latter atonis happen to fit the pores better than the
smooth ones, and produce a bitter flavour.

673—686: next to explain smell: it must stream on all sides from
many things3 but, as in taste, one kind suits one creature, another
another3 bees are attracted from far by the smell of honey, and so on;
