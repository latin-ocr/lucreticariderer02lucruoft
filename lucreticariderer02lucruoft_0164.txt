156 BOOK 11 NOTES 11

λύσεσι τῶν συγκρίσεων στερεὸν καὶ ἀδιάλυτον, ὃ *rtis μεταβολὰς οὐκ εἷς
τὸ μὴ ὂν ποιήσεται οὐδ’ ἐκ τοῦ μή civ-ros: and Diog. 44 referring forwards
to this passage adds τὸ δὲ χρῶμα παρὰ τὴν θέσιν τῶν ἀτόμων ἅλάττε-
σθαι ἐν ταῖς δώδεκα στοιχειώσεσί φησι (Ἐπι’κ.). Democritus, as appears
from Diogenes Sextus Stobaeus and others, held quite the same views.
'730 Nunc aye calls for attention as he is passing to a new and important
argument. '731 albis ex: see 11. to 1 841. ’733 ηἰῃναηι, a very rare
word except in the preS. partio. '734 Nive: 111 286 Ni3 [Lucil. XXIX
73 ni rediret‚] Catul. 61 153, and 2Aen. 111 686: Orell. inscr. Lat. 4783
royo per deos superos inferosque ni velitis ossa mea violare: the new
corp. inser. Lat. has many instances of ni and nive and more than 100
of nei and neive which connect the ni with the common form ne: see
also Donatus quoted to 1 277 nimi rum. inb. colorem: Virg. geor. 111
307 Vellera . . Tyrios incocta rubores3 Tac. hist. v 5 nec quicquam prius
inbuuntur quam contemnere cleos3 111 74 aramque posuit casus suos in
marmore escpressam, imitated from Val. Flacc. 1 398 casusque tuos
empressa, Phalere, Arma yerisj id. ΙΙ 655 Pocula bellorum casus empressa3
1 402 caelata metus alios yerit arma: [comp. also Draeger hist. synt. 1 p.
335 (inscriptus, suspensus, cet), and Stat. Theb. 1v 267 pictus praelim]
‘740 (enimi iniectus: 1047 animi iactus liber quo pervolet ipse: comp.
Cic. de nat. deor. 1 54 there quoted, who uses in quam se iniciens
animus in the same way: Gronovius obs. 1 4 p. 65 shews that both
Cicero and Lucr. are translating Epicurus' technical word ἐπιβολή or
ἦ φανταστικὴ ἐπιβολῆς comp. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. x 62, where
τὸ κατ’ ἐπιβολήν λαμβανόμενον τῇ διανοίᾳ is opposed to What is perceived
by 661166 3 they are the two great ways by which truth can be arrived at.
'741 caecigseni seems peculiar to Lucr. '743 Em ineunte aevo recurs 111
Lucr. five times and always denotes, as here, the beginning of the life or
existence of some living or inanimate things. '748 a verse must be
lost here, such as Corpora qnae constant nullo coniuncta colore. '749
Omnia omnino, in omnis. The argument is curtly but clearly expressed:
any colour may change into any other 3 if then white colour comes from
white atonis, black from black, the atonis must change 3 but this we have
proved to be impossible. 751-754 = 1 790—793. 755 continqas:
see 11. to 1 934.

757—787: again if atonis have no colonr, but beget any colour by
their different shapes positions motions and the like, you can explain
change of colour: thus the green sea becomes white: why? by its
elements changing their order, and by some going, others coming: but
green elements could not become white. But if you say they have differ-
ent colours, then you should see in the one colour of the sea others quite
different mixed up, as in a square composed of various shapes you see
these shapes: again these shapes do not prevent the whole exterior being
square ; but different colours would prevent a thing being of one colour.
