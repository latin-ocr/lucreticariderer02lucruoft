blance between their two systems 3 this especially that the first-beginnings
of each were imperishable‚ and that life and death were but the passing
to and fro of elements into things and things into elements. All this
being considered, we may grant that his lofty panegyric is justified by
the large fragments we possess of Empedocles' chief poem, nearly 400 out
of 2000 verses : yet the voczfirantm‘ cet. stands in striking contrast to
Aristotle's εἲ ψελλίζεται λέγων Ἐμπεδοκλῆς : but that stern judge is refer-

hostile one to the other3 and thus, like lightning clouds winds, will be
apt to fiy asunder one from the other rather than combine. '734 tamen,
