BOOK IV NOTES II 243

and move as we do, because when you withdraw from any part of the
mirror, images cannot come from that part of the mirror. 271 Quod
qe‘nus: see n. to 11 194. vere: to me it appears marvellous that Lach.
should say ‘vere non modo supervacaneum est, sed caret sensu': it clearly
refers to the real objects seen by images coming from them directly in
contrast to the mere reflexions from a mirror, of yourself for instance:
258 res ipsae perspiciantur. 2¹71 and 278 transpiciuntur, 272 tran-
spectum occur in no other writer of authority. 274 duplici qemiuoque
appears a pure tautology: 451 Binaque per totas aedis qeminare supelleae 3

faces caeli flammaeque volantes. 277 per·ter9et : 249 Et quasi perter-
9et pupillas and 252 Et nostros oculos perterqet louqior aura: comp. the
whole argument there. 278 et illa : and then those things by means
of the images streaming from them incessantly. 280 protrudit cet.:
comp. the quite similar argument 246f011. 290 Illic i.e. ab speculo
tantum semota. 291 utraque i.e. both in the case of things seen
through the open door and in a mirror: see n. to 86. Lucr. seems to
have thoroughly felt that distance was 'hot perceived by the eye, but was
a matter of mere inference. 298 fronte = a fronte : the mask must be
dashed straight on the post so as to preserve the right lines of the fea-
tures in front: otherwise if it were struck obliquely so as to distort the
lines, the face could not keep its shape when struck back. 301 6 laevo

18 (lv 8) sex septemve: it is possible that Lucr. wrote Qu. et. seat, on the
analogy of 3693 septem, which occurs in Cicero Terence and Horace, though
577 Lucr. has Sex etiam aut septem: just as Sen. Herc. Fur. 1006 has

Bis ter on the analogy of ter quater. 308 speculo: the omission of the
prep. seems harsh3 and perhaps 6 should be read: but speculo may be
the abl. instrum. 309 rusum: see n. to 111 45. 310 eodem eadem

eaedem idem plur. and isdem, as said to 1 306, are found as disyll. in
Lucr.: the last three are never with him trisyll.

313 Deaetera sim. i.e. images turned as a man would be if looking at
himself, right answering to right, left to left 3 whereas, as he has just ex-
plained, the image from a flat mirror is exactly inverted, right answering
to left, left to right. ea propter i.e. propterea: see n. to 28: Bentl. after
