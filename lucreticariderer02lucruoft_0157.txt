569—580: thus productiori and destruction alternately prevail, their
elements ever waging equa] war: no day passes without some dying, some
being born. 569 itaque: for its place in the sentence see n. to 1 419

which tend to preserve or destroy anything are alike infinite. 571

57¹7 visentis is nom. plun: see n. to Ι 808 animantis. 578 Every
minute dies a man, E very minute one is born. Here he has been content
perhaps to sacrifice philosophical to poetica] distinctness: what as an
epicurean he means to say is that in the universe of things death and
destruction are evenly balanced by life and productiori. Wishing to
illustrate this doctrine, he has drawn his images from the apparent
equality that there is in our world, so long as things continue as they
are. But he elsewhere teaches‚ as his system required him to do7 that
our world came into being only yesterday, and sooner or later must be
destroyed in an instant with all that is in it. What becomes then of
this balance so far as we are concerned? he no doubt felt that its ruins
would go to construet something else 3 but that he has not said. This
balance of the whole universe, says the epicurean in Cic. de nat. deor. Ι
50 ἰσονομίαν appellat Epicurus, id est aequabilem tributionem...et, si
quae interemant innumerabilia sint, etiam ea quae conservent ‘infinita
esse debere.

581—599: this you must carefully bear in mind: the more powers
and properties anything possesses, the greater variety of elements it con-
tains: thus the earth has elements out of which seas and fountains and
fires, out of which crops and trees, rivers and pastures are supplied,- it
is therefore called mother of gods, men and beasts alike. 581 obsiy-
natum: the force of the metaphor is obvious : the signing and sealing a
document is a proof of its importance. quoque would certainly seem to
belong rather to Illud than to obsigsnatum5 as 216 Illud in lais quoque te
