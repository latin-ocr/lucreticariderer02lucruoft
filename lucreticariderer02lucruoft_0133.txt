κίνησις κατ-οὶ στάθμην or natural motion sheer downwards. 85 ictu
alterius, the motion ἅνω κατὰ πληγήν καὶ παλμόν; therefore he adds
forte, because this motion is casual. cita: See n. to 1 1001. saepe: see
n. to v 1231. 88 ibus Lach. Wrongly introduces by conjecture into
two other places3 but it recurs Ι believe vl 1012: whatever its quantity
in Plautus, ibus, as you might expect from quibus, is that of hexam.
verse 3 as in Lucil. lib. inc. 114 Mueller: for demonstr. pron. connected
with rel. of preceding v. see n. to 1 718. 90 reminiscere, as proved
1 958 foll. totius summa, another name for the omne. 91 for the
position of corpora in the second clause see n. to 1 15: with neque habere
ubi comp. v1 1052 neque babet qua tranet ut ante3 Livy XXVII 12 3 nec
ubi consisteret...lzabenti; Cic. ad Att. XIII 2 2 pedem ubi ponat in suo
non liabet3 [Brutus ap. Cic. epist. x1 1 4 ubi consistamus non habemus]
92 foll. notice the poetical tautology to emphasise what he says, sine
fine modoque, inmensum patere, in cunetas partis and undique3 ostendi
and probatumst3 and co'mp. 1 1006 1007. 94 Pluribus ost. 1 988...

96 reddita in this sense of assigned as a property or the like is very
common in Lucu: see 65 Reddita mobilitas cet. 3 also 142, 681, 758, 1
203, 577, 111 618, 1v 178, v1 494. 97 exercita: 120 Conciliis et disei-
diis exercita crebris 3 1v 862 emercita motu. 98 confulta is a ἅπαξ
λεγόμ.; if the word is right, which is somewhat doubtful, it must mean,
resting and pressing one against the other, as the finer and smoother
atoms would do, which form the air, sunlight, etc.: it=mutuo fulta:
comp. Stat. Theb. v1 862 diu pendent per mutua lelti Bracchia. The abl.
magnis interv. and 99 brev. spatiis and 101 Eaiyuis int. mean leaving
great or small spaces between, with great or small spaces between: the
great and small are of course relative merely, and have reference to the
extremely minute atoms 3 the great distance would be inconceivably
small in relation to anything of sensible magnitude: comp. Epic. Diog.
Laerb. X 43 καὶ αἱ μὲν μακρσῖν ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων διίστανται, αἱ δ’ αὐτὸν τᾶν παλμὸν
ἴσχουσιν, ὅταν τύχωσιν ἐπὶ τήν περιπλοκὴν κεκλιμέναι ἢ στεγαζόμεναι παρὰ
τῶν πλεκτικῶκ some rebound far, when the atoms are smooth 3 others
have simply a throbbing or oscillation‚ when they have got entangled or
covered in by those which are shaped for entangling. However close
they are, even if in a mass of iron, ‘there is space between them: they
collide, they recoil, they oscillate', to use Tyndall⁷s words. And this
continual oscillation of atoms, in a lump of iron even, goes on exaotly at
the same speed as that of the atoms racing down space: strange as may
appear this anticipation by Epic. and Lucr. of modern theory. The force
of στεγαζόμεναι in relation to the moving atoms is well illustrated by its
use in 66, where Epic. is speaking of the soul: ὅταν w? στεγάζοντα καὶ
περιέχοντα μὴ τοιαῦτ’ ᾖ ἐν οἷς νῦν οὖσα ἔχει ταύτας τοῖς κινήσεις. 99 ab

ictu: see n. to vl 968. 102 perpleoeisfi9.: 459 perplexis indupedita ;
