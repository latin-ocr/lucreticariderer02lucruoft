flourish and decay. 1242 plumb. pot. : so venti, animae, animi, corporis
potestas and the like: a favourite periphrasis, with the same force as vis.
1243 fou: ‘comp Arist. mir. ausc. 87' H. Nettleship. 1246 form.
erqo: ΙΙΙ 78 statuarum et nominis erqo 3 Livy XXII 38 4 suque atque
formidinis erqo. 1248 pandere must mean, to open up and clear of
trees. pascua is the adj. 1251 saepire...ciere: Virg. 001. Χ 57 and
geor. 1 140 canibus circumdare saltus. 1256 αγ9οηιί eet: Virg. geor.
11 165 arqenti rivos aerisque metalla, Ostendit venis atque auro plurima
fluoeit: Milton too par. lost XI 565 has imitated all this passage, two
massy clods of iron and brasc Had melted, whether found where casual
fire Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale Down to the veins of earth,-
thence ylidiny hot Το some cave's mouth etc. 1262 penetr. eos i.e.
penetrabat in animos eorum: I do not find an exaotly similar instance,
but Wak. quotes Tac. ann. ΙΙΙ 4 nihil tamen Tiberium massis penetravit
quam cet. 1266 darent i. e. hae res, possent i.e. ipsi. 1268 tere-
brare, pertundere, perforare: I do not know if Lucr. meant accurately to
distinguish these words, or whether he uses them tautologically more or
1088. terebra appears to mean gimlet and auger and drill3 and I find
terebra pertundere, and terebra perforare in good authors: perhaps tere-
brare is to bore with a gimlet, the oldest sense of terebra 3 pertundere to

pieree with a punch 3 22e7Jbo⁴are to bore with auger or drill. 1270
violentis, applied to copper is poetical. 1275 insum. succ. hom: 1123
acl summum succedere honorem. 1276 volvenda: see n. to 514 volvenda

sidera. tempora rerum is much the same as statum rerum: Wak.
compares Aen. vu 37 quae tempora rerum, Quis Latio antiquo fuerit
status: comp. too Cic. ad fam. 11 18 3 tempora autem reipublicae qualia
futura sint, quis scit? 1276 foll.: comp. 831 Omnia conwnutat natura
et vertere coyit. Namque aliut putrescit et aevo debile lanquet, Porro aliut
clarescit et e contemptibus exit.

1281—1307: for arms men used at first hands nails teeth clubs‚
then fire, then copper or brass, at last iron3 horses next, then chariots‚
then elephants were employed in war, strife begetting one horror after
another. 1283 Arma cet: Hor. sat. 1 3 101 Unyuibus et puynis, dein
fustibus, atque ita porro Puynabunt armis. 1289 Aere cet.: doubtless,
as hamb. sayS, he was thinking of Hesiod works and days 150 Τοῖς δ’ ἦν
χάλκεα μὲν τεύχεα, χάλκεοι δέ τε οἶκοι, χαλκῷ δ’ εἰργάζοντο· μέλας δ’ οὐκ
ἔσκε σίδηρος. 1290 Miscebant: there is perhaps in this word a blend-
ing of the notions of miscere fluctus and miscere proelia. fluctus: we
have the same metaphor in 1435 belli maynos commovit funditus aestus.
vasta seems to unite the ideas of huge and ugly, misshapeu. serebant:
it is not clear to me from which of the two verbs this comes: it may
mean ‘scattered broadcast’‚ a stronger term than sparyebant: comp.
lumine conserit arva 3 or, as Livy and others have levia certamina serens,
certamina serebant, etc. with the force of conserere, Lucr. may extend
