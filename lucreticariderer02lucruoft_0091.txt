v 723 quaecumque est iynibus aucta. 632 habere belongs of course to
possunt, as well as debet 3 so that it is perhaps best taken as another
instance of that involved structure which I have illustrated at 111 843:
non possunt ea habere quae d. 9. m. : comp. 648 649. ca quae, all which
properties the atoms have: they possess size shape weight‚ which enable
them, as we shall see, to move, to clash‚ and join together 3 none of which
functions those minimae partes destitute of all qualities, if existing alone
could perform. 633 coneaeuS, conecto, coniaeus, conivere, conubium in
our mss. and all good mss. are always spelt with one n: there is no
authority whatever for nn. 628—634 what Lucr. felt and meant to
express in these vss. might be illustrated by these words of Prof. Max-
wellin his Theory of heat p. 285: ‘we do not assert that there is an
absolute limit to the divisibility of matter: what we assert is that after
we have divided a body into a certain finite number of constituent parts
called molecules, then any further division of these molecules will deprive
them of the properties which give rise to the phenomena observed in the
substance '.

635—644: to maintain therefore with Heraclitus and his followers
that fire is the element of all things is absurd.—Lucr. having now estab-
lished his two great principles of an unchangeable matter and a void,
before he proceeds at 921 to explain by them the nature of things, first
in order to make their truth still more manifest, examines the elements
of Heraclitus¹ Empedocles Anaxagoras and other philosophers and shews
their utter insufficiency. The foundation therefore being worthless, the
superstructure must fall to pieces: Principiis tamen in rerum fecere
ruinas et graviter magni magno cecidere ibi casu. Of all these men he
speaks with admiration or tolerance, except Heraclitus whom he assails
with a certain passion and violence. Now that the star of the old
Ephesian seems again in the ascendant, such an attack will not meet
with much sympathy3 the motive however is plain enough: in him he
is combating the stoics, the bitter enemies of Epicurus, Heraclitus stand-
ing in the same relation to them that Democritus stands to Epicurus.
This will appear from the fact that it is only from 690 to 704 that he
addresses himself to Heraclitus 3 from 645 to 689 it is always ‘they'x
faciant, cernunt, amittunt etc.; and by such indefinite plurals he else-
where denotes the stoics: see n. to 465. Indeed 643 644 seem to shew,
as we might expect, that he was not insensible to that style and those
sayings which sound so grandly even now in the few fragments that have
survived. One in the position of Lucr. could only see and criticise a
rival philosopher from his own point of view: even Aristotle is taxed
with thus dealing with Heraclitus. The πῦρ ἀείζωον φρόνιμον, the πάντα
