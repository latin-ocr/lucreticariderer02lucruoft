annals of Ennius 3 twice in Virgil, once in Valerius*Flaccus, [and in

25 de rerum natura: this title he doubtless gave to his poem in
imitation of Epicurus' great work περὶ φύσεως 111 37 books, of which
some miserable and ill-deciphered fragments are published in the volu-
mina Herculanensia. The same title was given by Empedocles to his
chief poem in 3 books, which must in some degree have served Lucr. for
a model. [Thus Galen says de elem. sec. Hipp. 1 9 τὰ γὰρ τῶν παλαιῶν
ἅπαντα περὶ φύσεως ἐπιγέγραπται, τὰ Μελίσσου, τσῖ Παρμενίδου, τοὶ

dativi-mv] Macrobius sat. VI 5, ἓ 2 and ξ 12, twice quotes Egnatius de
rerum natura: he preceded Virgil who imitates him, and can scarcely
have been later than Lucr. as he elides the final s. What he means by
rerum natura will sufficiently appear in the course of the poem: they
are two of four words, corpus and ratio being the other two, which occur
with such curicus frequency. Perhaps every one of the many meanings
which natura has in Cicero or nature in English 15 found in Lucr.
Sometimes it is an active force or agency, sometimes an inert mass 3
sometimes an abstract term 3 sometimes, as 1 419, it seems synonymous
with the omne. Res has with him many abstract meanings 3 but as a
physical term it signifies composite things in being in conti-adistinction
to the primordia or corpora prima out of which things are made : 1 420,
449, 504 are apparent rather than real exceptions: natura rerum is
therefore coextensive with the summa rerum, comprehending the infinity
of worlds in being throughout the omne, and denoting sometimes this
summa itself, sometimes that universally pervading agency by which the
summa goes on. 1v 385 naturam noscere rerum=causas cognoscere
