250 BOOK IV NOTES II

contra sensus cet. so that Lucr. may well be alluding to his paradoxeS.
id quoque nescit cet.: Metrodorus of Chios a great admirer of Democritus
pushed the paradox to this extreme: Cic. l. l. 73 says of him initio libri
qui est de natura ‘neqo' inquit ‘scire nos sciamusne aliquid an nihil
sciamus, ne id ipsum quidem, nescire* aut scire, scire nos⁷ nec omnino sitne
aliquid an nihil sit': the original is quoted by Sextus and Eusebius.
471 mittamzomittam: 111 961 mitte, vl 1056 mirari mitte. contendere
causam is not easy to explain: Lamb. compares Cic. in Catil. 11 25
causas ipsas, quae inter se confliyunt‚ contendere ; but there contendere
is simply to compare together, as in pro Sex. Rosc. 93: a sense scarcely
suitable here 3 unless the words can mean ‘contendere meam causam cum
illius omittam': Gronov. obs. 111 19 compares it with cernere vitam,
cernere bellum, pugnare puynam and the like 3 and this is probably right:
it will thereforezcontendere et agere causam; cum contentione agere
causam. causans for causam would be an easy emendation. 472
Qui capite cet. appears to be a proverb: Plaut. curc. ‘287 Quin cadat, quin
capite sistat in via de semita3 Ter. ad. 316 Sublimem medium arriperem
et capite in terram statuerem: but its precise force is not very clear:
Gronov. 1. l. explains it by ‘qui sibi non constat, qui se ipse evertit, qui
cernuat': this would suit the context ; but a man who tumbles on his
head, does not place his head where his feet were. Perhaps by a man
putting his head where his feet should be is meant that he assumes as
his premiss that nothing can be known, which is the conclusion that
ought to be, but cannot be proved by such a premiss: the man thus
inverts himself in a manner. Locke essay 1v 11 3 11868 very similar
language, ‘I think nobody ean in eal-nest be so sceptical as to be uncer-
tain of the existence of those things which he sees and feels. At least
he that can doubt so far, whatever he may have with his own thoughts,
will never have any controversy with me3 since he can never be sure I
say anything contrary to his opinion', and 8 ‘if all be a dream, then he
doth but dream that he makes the question 5 and so it is not much matter
that a waking man should answer him.'

478 Invenies: whatever he may say, you will find that no other real
answer can be given, except that all truth depends first on the senses.
primis: comp. 11 loso and 111 250. 484 quae tota cet.: 1 694 unde
omnia credita pendent. 493 coniuncta: 1 449 aut his coniuncta
duabus Rebus ca invenies: and see n. there: it would then mean here the
conditions, of light etan, which are necessarily connected with colour;
but this can hardly be right: it is rather to be compared with 11 742
cossnoscant corpora tactu Ea: ineunte aevo nullo coniuncta colore3 and
means simply ‘and so see the objects which are seen by colour': anyhow
the phrase is curious. 497 ipsi repr. sese i.e. the same sense at one
time cannot refute the same sense at another: Cic. acad. pr. 11 79 eo
enim rem demittit Epicurus, si unus sensus semel in vita mentitus sit,
