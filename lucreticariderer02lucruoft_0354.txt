this meaning to serere vulnera, they joined, applied or the like: but
sermones, colloquia, circulos, haec sermonibus, Haec inter sese vario
sermone serebant, seem equally ambiguous: Livy XXI 6 1 writes certa-
mina cum finitimis serebantur, maa-ime Turdetanis. quibus cum adesset
idem qui litis erat sator: such apposition could scarce fail to confuse in a·
Latin's mind the two ineanings of serebantur. Fronto ad Verum 8 has
quam libenter eonsevisti sermonem. 1294 Versaque cet. may refer, as -
Bentl. says, to its use in magical and unlawful rites: Aen. Iv 513 Falci-

following infinitives as 1250 venarier, are all used as substantives: see

confirms this tradition: the expression is found in Naevius, Sen. Hippol.,
Silius and others, [and appears now to be the true reading in Plautus
Cas-in. 704. Pausanias lx 21 2 calls the rhinoceros bos aethiops (Friedl.

1308—1349: bulls boars and lions too were tried in war 3 but they
often turned upon their owners, as elephants are sometimes seen to do
