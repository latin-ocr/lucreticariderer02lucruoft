771—782: having thus explained how all that goes on above in the
heaven may take place, the movements of sun and moon and their
eclipses, I now come back to the infancy of the world and the earth and
proceed to shew what then came to pass. '773 quicquid = quicque, as
so often in Lucr. resolvi : v1 46 Pleraque ressolui, where he is talking
of the same questions: a rare use of the word, not unlike that in Quintil.

'774 Virgil says obscurely caelique vias and caelique-meatus, with refer-
ence probably to this passage. 776 offecto: see n. to 11 156 Officium-

nec opim: neque opinans, which appears to be very rare, occurs more
than once in the bell. Alexandr. and the more homely bell. Africae: see
Nipperdey Caes. p. 27, who refers to the epist. ad Brutum 1 4 4: it is ’
found too in Lucil. lv 41 Muell. '7¹79 convisunt keeps up the meta-

783—820: first herbage sprang up, then trees, then living things 3
in the newness 01 creation the earth produced the lai-ger creatures, birds
first, even as now it produces spontaneously worms and the like3 then
lastly man, whom it fed from its pores with a moisture resembling milk:
in the perpetual spring of the new world the children needed nothing
more than what the earth thus supplied. '783 Principio cet: in their
account of the first production of things the early philosophers would be
likely to agree more or less: Zeller says that Anaximander, Parmenides,
Anaxagoras, Diogenes of Apollonia and Democritus, all taught the pro-
creation 01 living things from earth. Lucr. probably had a special eye to
Empedocles3 thus we are told in Plut. de plac. phil. v 26 and Galen that
Empedocles πρῶτα τῶν ζώων τοὶ δένδρα ἐκ γῆς ἀναδῦναί φησι, plants with

they are born before they begin to perform any of the functions of life 3
so the earth as soon as formed began to put forth its hairs or feathers,
