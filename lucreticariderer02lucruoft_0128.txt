granted that these refinements can supply at times many exquisite
delights‚ yet nature in their absence can be satisfied often with the sim-
plest enjoyments. Delicias has thus its proper force, exactly as in v

siqna polire. The poet could well enjoy these refinements‚ but could also
do without them. interdum: its position is emphatic and in the manner
of Lucr.: v 602 Nonne vides etiam quam late parvus aquai Prata riqet

dia interdum cet. 22 substernere appears to have much the same force
as the simple sternere: the sub perhaps has the meaning it sometimes has
in subministrare and submittere, of a successive or continued supply.

often had in archaic Latin, and which is not uncommon in classical: so

is common enough in Plautus, as trin. 282 where the palimpsest has
