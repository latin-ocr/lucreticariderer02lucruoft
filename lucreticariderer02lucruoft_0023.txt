TO NOTES II 15

in the rhythmical movement which he impresses on a whole passage
Lucretius is a far less careful and skilled artist than Virgil. The effect
which his grandest passages produce is owing more to the vigour and
originality of the thought and the force and freshness of the expression
than to studied polish and elaboration.

One of the most marked peculiarities of the old Latin writers is their
extreme fondness for alliteration, assonance, repetition of the same or
similar words syllables and sounds, often brought together and combined
in the most complex fashion. In Latin, as in some other languages,
this usage was clearly transmitted from most ancient times, and is not
the invention of any one writer. Ennius and the serious poets use it
to produce a poetical effect 3 Plautus and the comic poets employ it for
comic purposes: the following from the captivi, Quanta pernis pestis
veniet, quanta labes larido, Quanta sumini apsumedo, qucmta callo cala-
mitas, Quanta laniis lassitudo, quanta porcinariis, will furnish a good
example. Cicero does not despise such artifices even in prose ; but none
scatters them about more prodigally than Lucretius both singly and in
manifold combination: they are to be counted in his poem by hundreds,
nay thousands‚ and many are noted in different parts of our commentary.
His alliterations comprise almost every letter of the alphabet ε the more
effective letters such as m p v pronounced w are often used with striking
effect. The last sometimes expresses pity as its sound well fits it to do:
Viva videns vivo sepeliri viscera busto : comp. Virgil's Neu patriae validas
’ἱη viscera vertite vires 3 and Cicero's vivus, ut aiunt, est et videns cum
victu ac vestitu suo publicatus: or force or violence, because the words
indicating such effects begin many of them with the letter: vivida vis
pervicit, venti vis verberat, vemorum validis viribus, Vel violenta viri vis,
quid volnera vellent: comp. Virgil's Fit via vi, Livy's vi viam faciunt,
Lucilius’ Vis est vita, vides, vis cet. ; Ennius’ vidi Priamo vi vitam
evitari 3 for effects of living shunning and the like are expressed by it
111 Lucretius also. Often various letters are used in combination: the
following is a good instance of m p and v : parare Non potuit, pedibus
qui pontum per vada possent Trcmsire et magmos manibus divellere montis
Multaque vivendo vitalia vincere saecla: comp. Ennius' Illarsa mames,
Paeliq‘na cohors, Vestina virum vis. Such combinations are common in
Virgil 3 but occur by hundreds in Lucretius. Then 116 delights in bring-
ing together words compounded of the same preposition by themselves
or in union with other sorts of alliteration or assonance: officium. . afficere
atque obstare, seiunyi seque 9reqmi, disturbans dissoluensque‚ retroque
repulsa reverti, condenso conciliatu, Eoeos et ewanguis, pertusum coozqesta
quasi in vas Commoda persium-ere (etque inqrata interiere : comp. Virgil's
Insomem ‘infando indicio and the like. Then he loves to bring together
the same or like-sounding words or examples of oxymoron in conj unction
with other alliterations and assonances or by themselves: omnes omnia,
