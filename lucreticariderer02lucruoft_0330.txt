roaring‚ though applied to Jupiter by Cicero and Ennius it signifies
thundering on high 3 and ‘on high' is the usual force in altivolans altiso-
‘nus and the like. 746 bruma may be used here in its proper sense of
the shortest day: it again brings back the cold which spring had dispelled,
and winter returns in earnest. '749 certo tempore, every day, that is:

751—7'70: solar eclipses may be caused by the moon intercepting
the rays, as the astronomers say 3 but some opaque and invisible body
may just as well be the cause; or the sun may lose for the time his own
light in passing through spots inimica] to it: lunar eclipses may sirni-
larly be explained, mutatis mutandis 3 thus in the first case it will be
the earth which keeps froin it the sun‘s mys—The three theories here
offered to explain the eclipses of the sun and moon are quite parallel to
those given just above to shew how the moon may receive her light.
Epic. l. l. 96 gives us a similar choice, ἔκλειψις ἧλίου καὶ σελήνης δύναται

Lucretius‘ conceptions were of the shape of the earth, they must surely
have blindly accepted from astronomers this fact of its conica] shadow:
the force of Menstrua is not at once apparent, as she has to pass most
months without any eclipse3 yet these do depend on her monthly revo-
lution3 and if her orbit lay in the plane of the ecliptic, there would of
course be an eclipse every full moon. 765 succurrere=succedere‚ used
