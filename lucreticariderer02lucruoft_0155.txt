is more than once passive in Virgil. 517 Omnis cet. is rightly
explained by N. P. Howard Journal of phil. 1 p. 126. The fires of mid-
summer and the frosts of winter are the two extremes, between which .
lies every degree of calor, friyus and medii tepores. 518 I nterutmsque

notes 1 of my second edition, comparing the adverbs alias alteras or else
foras: Buecheler Lat. decl. p. 32 cites Nonius p. 183 for utrasque,
which in Cassius Hemina signifies ‘both times’, in Caecilius ‘on both
sides '. The origin of these forms is nowise clear, as is the case with

many other adverbs in Latin. 520 mucroni: the metaphor must be -

522—568 ε the number of shapes being finite, the nuniber of atoms
of each shape is infinite, since it was proved in the first book that the
sum of matter was infinite: if you say some animals are more scarce
than would be the case, if the atoms of which they were made were
infinite, I answer these animals may be very numerous in remote regionsg
but even if but one thing of its kind existed in the whole world, this
would imply an infinite sum of atoms; else how could these have met
and united in the boundless ocean of matter? the first-beginnings there-
fore of every shape and kind are infinite in number. 522 foll. see
Epicurus cited to 478 foll. who precisely agrees with Lucr. 525
cluere z esse. etenim cet. for no finite number multiplied by any finite
number however large can produce an infinite sum. And as Epicurus
and Lucr. conceived all infinites to be equal, the atoms of each shape
must to them have been equal to the sum of all the atoms of all shapes;
which seems absurd 3 but this opinion they shared with all the ancients,
and moderns till comparatively recent times: Philoponus‚ l. 1. to the last
sectiou, has a curious argument to shew that Democritus holding the
atoms of each shape to be infinite must have held that there was τοῦ
οἷπείρου ἅπειρότερόν τι, and that the epicureans teaching that the num-
ber 111 each shape was infinite must have believed the same: this to him
seemed an absurdity 3 and it must have puzzled Epicurus and Lucr.
