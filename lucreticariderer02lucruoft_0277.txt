905 trocleas were certain arrangements of blocks of pulleys, described by
Cato and Vitruvius. tympana seem to have been wheels which revolved
by men treading on thern, and raised to their places columns and other
heavy weights; both the trocleas and tympana being portions of the same
machina. pondere magno: abl. of quality depending on AlIuIta: it
gains force by its position: comp. v 556 quam mayno pondere nobis Sus-

907—928: sleep takes place, when the soul is scattered in the body,
and part of it has gone out, part withdrawn into the depths of the body:
only part however ean go forth 3 else death would ensue; enough must
stay behind to let sense be rekindled, as fire is rekindled when buried
under the ashes. 90¹7 somnus cet: Macrob. sat. VI 1 44 compares

Marullus says in marg. cod. Victor. ‘sic Catullus Troia virum et virta-
tum omnium acerba cinis' and at bottom of the page ‘cinis feminino
Catullus Virg. in ceter. masculino': he is in error as to Virgil: Nonius
says it is fem. in Caesar and Calvus 3 and Charisius 1, p. 101 Keil,
quotes from the latter fulva cinis and ipsa cinis. 927 reconflari seems
not to occur elsewhere: the metaphor is of course from kindling fire.
929-961: sleep is thus produced: the body is constantly beaten
upon by the outer air as well as by that which is inhaled by breathing;
thus assailed within and without the body gives way, and the soul is
disordered, part of it as has been said leaving the body, part withdraw-
ing into its recesses, while the rest cannot perform its functions: thus
the body too becomes languid and powerless: again sleep follows eating,
because the food in passing into the system acts on it as the air does 3
and the disorder of the soul is then greater than ever. 934 eius i.e.
