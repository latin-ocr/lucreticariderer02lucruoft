Lat. VI 8 ‘tempus a bruma ad brumam, dum sol redit, vocatur annus,
quod ut parvi circuli anuli, sic magni dicebantur circites ani, unde
annus'3 but in Lucr. the coming together of annis and Anulus is quite-
accidental: v 644 Quae volvunt ‘maynos in magmis orbibus annos, of stellar-
yearS. 312 anulus, not ann. habendo has not the same subject

313 Stilicidi ε Lach. in a masterly note shews that when a long vowel is
followed by ll, one l is withdrawn When an i follows, if this i be not
merely the mark of a case, as villa villis : thus Messalla Messalina 3 ‘mille
milia 3 villa vilicus 3 stilla stilicidimn 3 for stiria shews that the i of
stilla is long. According to this rule Polio is right, and Servius
recognises both Polio and Pollio, and Πωλίων 15 the usual Greek form 3
but Roman usage seems to have declared for Pollio 3 in the new corpus
inscr. Lat. vol. 1 Pollio is found 6 times² Polio once 3 in Mommsen's
inser. reg. Neapol. always Pollio3 and so the mss. of Virgi13 but Pal.
and Med. fail in the four places where his name occurs 3 Pollio too the
collated mss. of Horace3 the Pith. of Juvenal vl 387 and vn 176 Polio,
lx 7 Pollio 3 the palimpsest of Fronto twice Polio. Augustus in his res
gestae has one striking violation of this law: he always writes millia
millibus milliens 3 and one or other of these words occurs more than 20
times: he probably so spelt from some notion of consistency 3 comp. his
simus for sumus : milites militare etc. he spells in the usual way. While
in a fine consular inscription of U. O. 622, corp. inscr. Lat. 1 551, we
have miliarias and twice meilia, ibid. 701 we find millia, 1012 millibus,
shewing that the rule was not then quite fixed. 314 occulte: Forc.
gives from Ovid an exactly similar use of the word. 315 strata vi.
Saoe.=stratas saxo vias: strata having the epithet saxea shews that
Lucr. treated it almost as a subst.3 even more harsh is v1 1283 aliena
rogorum extructa. He uses this constr. more freely than most of the
poets: 500 Conington to Aen. 1 422 ; we had in 86 a very bold instance :
clausa domorum, eaetructa domorum, and with a gen. sing. vera viai,
caerula caeli, sublima caeli are some of many other examples. 316

Samothracia ante portas statuit duas virilis species aeneas, clei maqni ε 110
