every animal has in it the heat, the spirit, and the air, but one animal
has more of one than of the other, and thus gets its distinctive character:
the lion has more of heat, the stag of spirit or wind, the ox of air: so is
it with men; their characters differ as they have more of one or of
another of these: yet reason will so keep down the too great influence
of any of them, that a wise man may live like a god. 258 see n. to 11

which he wishes to point attention at once to the exceeding fineness and

with the others, yet keeps itself withdrawn and is known only by its
effects3 so the other three must keep themselves each one in due subor—
dination or prominence according to the nature in which they are, lest
by acting independently they should ruin one another and destroy sense.
