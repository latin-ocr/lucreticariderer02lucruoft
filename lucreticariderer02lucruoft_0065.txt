Terence, Caecilius, etc., Ribbeck, Beitr. z. 1. v. d. Lat. partik. p. 17, is
prob. right in saying that nimirum Ξ ni or nisi est mirum: Caecil. 254
nomen viminis, nisi mirum est, deinteqrabit. Lucr. is peculiarly fond of
this word: he generally employs it in drawing what he thinks a certain
conclusion from what precedes corp. caeca, as 295: sometimes he
applies the phrase to his invisible first-beginnings 3 as 328 Corporibus
caecis = 1110 primordia caeca. 278 denique often thus added to the
last item in an enuineration without giving it any prominence over the
others3 as 435 Auymine vel yrcmdi vel parvo denique, 11 1081 sic monti-

of these cases the et of comparison is followed by c or qu or a vowel:

ac before c 9 01 qu with one exception, VI 440 simul ac yravidam, as
simul ut was not used by him : simul ac foll. by c is the sole exception
to the rule in Catullus and Ovid: it is observed by Propertius: Livy
often neglects it. 281 foll: there are three similes in the Iliad,
Δ 452, Ε 87, Α 492, each of which, especially the two last, Lucr. may
here have had in his mind: ποταμῷ πλήθοντι ἐοικώς Χειμάρρῳ ὅστ’ ὦκα

usage of Lucr. requires it to agree rather with natura3 as 11 232
