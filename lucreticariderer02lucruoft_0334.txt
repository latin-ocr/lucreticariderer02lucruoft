837—854: at first the earth tried to produce monsters of all kinds,
half-men half-women, creatures without feet or without hands or mouths,
or with limbs not separated ; so that they could not grow up nor continue
their kind: they all therefore perished off. 839 Androqynum: Livy

partly refutes Empedocles: 235 Πολλοὶ μὲν ἀμφιπρόσωπα καὶ ἅμφίστερν’

accord; the Βουγενῆ-βούκρανα he wholly disallows, as we shall see 878

hist. synt. 1 p. 454.] 840 841 here too Lucr. seems to be imitating
the manner of Empedocles, while differing entirely in the matter: 232
