inqens yeminatque nefas: Virgil on the contrary has que 111 the third
place only with monosyl. prepos. and their cases and with iamque namque
according to Wagner geor. 1 142 : 11 1099 Lucr. has ve too in the third
place, Omnibus inve locis, and 1v 616 plus operaeve: comp. Hor. od. IV 2 21
Flebili sponsae iuvenemve. Perhaps Lucretius' carelessness in the position
of quoque is like in principle3 see n. to v 192: itaque, iqitur, enim he
also often puts late in the sentence 3 see n. to 1 419. On the other hand
it is to be noted that, like the older poets generally, he always has the
copulae et, nec, nam 111 the first place 3 while Virgil and the later poets
often transgress this rule. 1051 elucet thus coupled by a simple et
with docui and vociferatur is somewhat awkward: one would have
expected a word meaning ‘to make clear? 1053 Undique vorsum: 188
Sursus enim versus: see Forc. for similar instances from Cicero Caesar
and the best writers, deorsum versus, utroque vorsum, quoquoversus and

VI 485 Innumerabilem enim numerum3 Plautus in his own epitaph, Et
numeri innumeri simul omnes collacrumarunt‚ which Ritschl parergon
p. 42 refers to the great variety of Plautus' metres: in number number-
less and numbers numberless are common in our old writers: not unlike
are innuptae nuptiae, mentes dementes, iniustaque iusta of other poets 3
and similar in effect are 1 98 casta inceste, 111 869 Mortalem vitam mors

not unconnnon in Lucr. and other poets: comp. VI 197 Conplerunt,

715, v 165, the word inmortalis occurs 3 so that in our verse and all the
others it may be presumed that the preposition of the compound formed
a quasi caesura 3 for in fact the Latins seem to have made no difference
in sound between in mortali and inmortali : Lucilius ventures to write
Scipiadae mayno improbus obiciebat Asellus 3 and Horace Vestrum praetor,
is intestabilis et sacer esto3 and in the new corp. inscr. Lat. we find on
the one hand ab iuraverit, ael tribuere 7 times, eo'c actum, in doucimus
and many such like 3 on the other hand aquo, amatre, adeum, desuo, εω-
