above, he nobly maintains the reputation claimed for his countrymen in.
that style of writing. The sixth book is unequal like the fifth: the
beginning as far as 95 is very unsatisfactory and confused, as has been
pointed out in the notes. Then follow some hundred verses in which
the nature and working of thunder and lightning, the formation of
clouds rain and the like are described. This portion is most carefully
elaborated. There is not much room for the highest virtues of poetry 3
but still great qualities are here brought into play, quickness of observa-
tion and power of describing what is observed, vivacity of narrative, fine
perception of analogy and much ingenuity of speculation : the language
is simple, terse, direct and telling. Most of these merits are displayed
in greater or less measure even in the flattest and most prosaic portions
of the poem3 but the verses here spoken of are not of this number.
Quite recently I was glad to find the opinion I had long entertained of
this section of the poem confirmed hy the greatest of German critics in
Riemer's Mittheilungen ueber Goethe 11 p. (345 3 and this is not the only
place in which Goethe expresses the most unbounded admiration for our
poet. What follows is not so satisfactory: Lucretius has to include a
great variety of questions in a very limited space. These seem to be
selected sometimes at hap-hazard: nearly 200 lines are given to the
magnet, lively verses enough and very ingenious, but out of all propor-
tion to the subject-matter. The description of the plague of Athens
concludes the book : it is manifestly unfinished 3 and though it contains
much noble poetry‚ it suffers from the unavoidable comparison with the
austere beauty and simple grandeur of its original, which the poet has
not always understood and from which he has sometimes departed with-
out good cause. He has shewn himself here both too much and too
little of a physician: he is too technical for the poet, too inaccurate for
the philosopher.

In style and language Lucretius has manifestly adopted a some-
what archaic tone, differing more or less from that of his extant con-
temporaries. This has been occasioned mainly by his admiration for
Ennius and Naevius and the old tragic poets Pacuvius and Accius ε their
extant fragments prove how carefully he had studied them. In Greek
literature too his tastes seem to have carried him to the older and more
illustrious writers. In this as in so many other respects he appears to
have stood quite aloof from the prevailing fashions of his day 3 for the
great mass of contemporary poets, among them even Catullus at all
events in his heroic and elegiae poems, chose to form their style after
Euphorion of Chalcis and the affected Alexandrine school of poets, Calli-
machus and the rest, whose influence extended far into the Augustan
age, though they wrote in what was to themselves really a dead language.
It is owing probably in great measure to his admiration for Lucretius
that Virgil and thereby Latin poetry were saved from falling even more
