and see n. to v 13 divina antiqua reperta, where the instances are some-
what different. Lucr. is fond of this periphrastic use of umor: he has
umor aquae, aquai, aquarum, sudoris, some of them repeatedly: lacteus
umor occurs more than once in Ovid. 260 Artubns: this form is re-
tained by our mss. in four other places: once only, v 1077, we find artibus:

263 264 Lucr. is fond of this doctrine that the death of one thing
is the birth of another and that the uniformity of nature is thereby
maintained. We shall have to say more at 11 70 of this theory as applied
to the universe of things: as here applied to this world of ours it is
hardly perhaps consistent with what is said 556, that the process of
destruction is much quicker than that of construction. Elsewhere too
he argues at great length and with much earnestness that this world
is of quite recent formation, and again that it not only 0311 but must and
will be destroyed in a moment of time. What becomes then of this un-
varying equality‚ at least thus unconditionally applied, nec ullam Rem
9i9ni cet? Lucr. doubtless had in his thoughts the old dogma of the
physici, more than once asserted by Aristotle, as metaph. 11 2 p. 994 b

not seen: many things in being you know by their effects, yet can not see:
