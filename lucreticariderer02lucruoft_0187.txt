Book 111 NOTEs 11 ’ 179

dispel the terrers of. hell which poison life: many boast they know all
this, but when tried by adversity, they choose to suffer any misery
rather than face death and its consequences: nay often men from this
fear will commit any crime, in order to get wealth and honour, thinking
that want and contempt destroy the security of life 3 hence civil war,
hence hatred of relations 3 hence men· often rush to death from sear of
death: this fear in short is the source of all evils: and can be destroyed
only by the true knowledge of nature. 31 cunct, emor. rer.=reru1n

p. 286] 57 that Catullus has not unfrequently imitated Lucretius, is
I think certain 3 but so far as I know, these imitations all occur in his
longest poem, the marriage of Peleus and Thetis 3 and most of them in
one Section of that poem. He seems to have published his works in
a collected form only a very short time before his early death which
happened, as Schwabe in his recent account of his life has given good
reasons for believing, within a year of the death of Lueretius The
poem in question then would appear to have been written or completed
just before this publication. The apparent imitations which I have ob-
served in Catullus' 64th poem Ι will now give. Compare 111 57 Nam
