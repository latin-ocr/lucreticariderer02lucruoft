1252—1286: the country-people flocked into the town and increased
the misery3 all public places, even the temples, were crowded with the
dead and dying3 religion and all the decencies of burial were neglected.

think cannot be right: 116 1163 shewn sufficiently from Vitruvius and
Priscian that astu or asty was used by the Romans for any case of ἄστυ ;
but its use here would be very abrupt, and Lucr. would I think have
said in astu, as Vitruvius twice does. The heat too was perhaps the
most marked cause of mortality, comp. the words of Thuc. here imitated,
ἄλλ’ ἐν καλύβαις πνιγηραῖς ὥρᾳ ἔτους διαιτωμένων ὁ φθόρος ἐγίγνετο οὐδενὶ
κόσμῳ; and Livy 111 6 3 ea colluvio mixtorum omnis yeneris animantium
et odore insolito urbanos et ayrestem confertum in arta tecta aestu ac
viqil iis anyebat, ministeriaque in vicem ao contayio ipsa vulyabant morbos ;
one does not wish to lose Conferte& any more than aestus 3 else aestu
Consectos would complete the sentence: Plaut. most. 764 is too corrupt
to support aestu in the sense ‘ during the heat.' I therefore think a V.
has been lost. 1264 Thuc. 52 2 καὶ ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς ἐκαλινδοῦντο καὶ περὶ
