atom could not have the qualities which birth-giving matter must have,
weight, motion, power of striking and clashing and combining.-—A
passage necessarily obscure, because dealing with one of those questions
which utterly elude the grasp of human reason. Epicurus building up
his dogmatic system and hating all scepticism on first principles, deter-
mined that his atoms should have size shape weight, in his own words
μέγεθος σχῆμα βάρος, and therefore extension. But if extension, then
parts 3 and how can that which has parts be indivisible2 This is the
question which Lucr. here answerS. That the atoms of Epicurus though
extremely small were finite and had parts, abundant proof was given in
Camb. Journal of phil. Ι p. 28 foll. and 252 foll. Comp. Epicurus quoted
a page after this and Stob. ecl. Ι 10 14 εἴρηται δὲ ἄτομος, οὐχ ὅτι ἐστὶν
ἐλαχίστη ἄλλ’ ὅτι οὐ δύναται τμηθῆναι, ἀπαθὴς οὖσα καὶ ἀμέτοχος κενοῦ ;
Simplic. to Arist. phys. p. 216 a, a few lines from end, though he varies
in his testimony about Democritus, says of Epicurus α’μερῆ μὲν οὔχ
ἡγεῖται, ἄτομα δὲ αὕτσῖ διοῖ τὴν ἀπάθειαν εἷναί dmm: see the journal
l. l. for proof that Democritus and Leucippus held the same doctrine
which they probably derived from the pythagoreans. Doubtless the
epicureans long waged bitter war with the peripatetics who held the
infinite divisibility of things: see Alex. Aphrod. to Arist. met. p. 745 4

imitation of the περὶ ψυχῆς 1 4 ε one of the commonest ternis with Epic.
for his atoms is ὄγκοι or bulks. Lucr. therefore seeks to maimtain at the
same time that cardinal point in the epicure‘an physics that atoms are
impenetrable and indestructible, and yet possessed of weight shape and
extension, and to shew how particles thus endowed are incapable of
further division: atoms have parts, but these parts are minima, the
ἐλάχιστα of Epicurus, not able to exist alone, abiding therefore in the
atom from all eternity in unchangeable juxta-position.

599 eaetr. quodque cao: see notes 1 for the probable nature of the
hiatus: the expression resembles therefore 578 quaeque...corpora rebus3
see note there: so that the συσίν. quodque cacumen here exactly equals
the emtremum cuiusque cacumen of 7 49, with which we have compared it
in the next page. 600 Corporis etc. is of course the atoni: corpora
or corpora, prima we have already found to be among his commonest
ternis for his atoms : 483 Corpora sunt porro partim primordia rerum 3
and so Stobaeus l. l. and Plut. de plac. phil. 1 3 p. 877 D say that
Epicurus defined τοῖς ἅρχοῖς τῶν ὄντων σώματα λόγῳ θεωρητά κ.τ.λ. ;
corpus is thus used in the sing. in 606 naturam corporiS, and 11 484
cuiusvis in brevitate Corporis, and 490 tocius corporis eius: though our
present passage has been grievously misunderstood, the words added
would seem to preclude any doubt, as well as the tenour of the whole
passage: illius qu. n. c. s. Iam nequeunt, he says3 and so 11 312 Omnis
euim lonqe ‘nostris ab sensibus infra Primorum natura iacet ,· quapropter
