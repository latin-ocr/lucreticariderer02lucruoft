BOOK 1 NOTEs II 81

always to be, like Epicurus’ ἐλάχιστον, a technical term for the smallest
thing that can exist, or the smallest effect that can be produced 3 and in
this sense occurs 1611 or eleven times in the poem: so Cic. de fin. 1 20 ‘ne
illud quidem physici credere aliquid esse minimum, and v 78 ea ‘nos mala
dicimus, sed eaeiyua et paene minima. 604 alterius, of the atom.

a further proof that the atoni is single and impenetrable. 611 not
like res, formed from a union of such parts, but of everlasting single-
ness‚ because its parts cannot exist out of the atom. 612 Sed

⁴613 iam, as 601: when you get to the atom, division stops: see n. to
11 426. In illustration of the above argument of Lucr. I cannot refrain
from quoting out of many the following sentences of Henry More: im-
mortality of the soul, preface 3 ‘I have taken the boldness to assert
that matter consists of parts indiscerpible, understanding by indiscerpi-
ble parts particles that have indeed real extension, but so little that
they cannot have less and be anything at all, and therefore cannot be
actually dividedz...the parts that constitute an indiscerpible particle are
real, but divisible only intellectually, it being of the very 65561106 of
whatever is, to have parts or extension in some measure 01· other 3 for
to take away all extension is to reduce a thing only to a mathematical
point, which is nothing else but pure negation or nonentity’. Ibid. 1 6 5
‘it is plain that one and the same thing, though intellectually divisible,
may yet be really indiscerpible. And indeed it is not only possible, but
it seems necessary that this should be true'.

615 and 621 parvissima used apparently, because minimum is wanted
to denote an absolute least thing 3 the word recurs 111 199 and is quoted
by Nonius from Varro: with this and what follows comp. Epicurus
himself in Diog. Laert. X 43 οὐδὲ γάρ, φησὶν ἐνδοτέρω, εἷς ἄπειρον ἦ τομή
