but to denote heat generally. yerebant simply in the sense of having is
common in the best writers: see n. to 111 1049: and is often used of the
parts of the body: Ov. met. 11 585 raeque iam palmas nec pectora moda

φλόγωσις of Thuc. and means Ι presume the glare of inflammation: Sen.

effert animi motus interprete linqua. 1151 Inde ubi cet.: it cannot
fairly be questioned that in these vss. Lucr. misrepresents Thuc. who
says that the disease first attacked the head, then the throat and tongue,
then 1. l. ἐν οὗ πολλῷ χρόνῳ κατέβαινεν ἐς τὰ στήθη ό πόνος, and then
always descending‚ ὁπότε ἐς τήν καρδίαν στηρίξαι, α’,νέστρεφέ τε αὐτήν καὶ
ἀποκαθάρσεις χολῆς πᾶσαι ὅσαι timi ἰατρῶν ὠνομασμέναι εἰσὶν ἐπῄεσαν, Le.
as all the commentators of Thuc. explain it, when it got below the breast
and reached the stomach, discharges of bile of every sort took place 3 it
being expressly stated on good authority that by καρδία the ancients,
particularly Hippocrates and Thuc., denoted τὸ στόμα τῆς γαστρός. But
Lucr. has evidently taken καρδία 111 its usual sense: such a mistake was
not unlikely to occur3 but it has caused him sadly to misrepresent the
case: he makes the disease not merely descend into the breast, but
wholly fill the breast, and stream together into the sad heart, and thus
at the very commencement of its course force all the fastnesses of life,
though the patients afterwards go through many stages of suffering and
live at least eight or nine days : Thuc. says some sentences later διεξῄει
γὰρ διὰ παντὸς τοῦ σώματος ἄνωθεν ἀρξάμενον τὸ ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ πρῶτον ἱδρυ-
θὲν κακόν. This error of Lucr. was pointed out by Victorius three cen-
turies ago in his variae lectiones XXVIII 17 and more fully in a letter to
Hieronymus Mercurialis published by Passow in 1832 z Lamb. in vain
asserts that Lucr. here uses cor for stomachus after the Greeks 3 his wide
departure from Thuc. and the whole turn of his language prove that cor
here, as elsewhere, means the seat of life 3 nor is there the least authority
for supposing that cor could have any other meaning. 1153 vit. cl. :

1158 1159: Thuc. adds to the words last quoted καὶ αὗται μετοὶ ταλαι-
πωρίας μεγάλης, referring to the great distress caused by the violent
vomitings: Lucr., having as we saw quite misrepresented the rest of the
sentence, would not understand these last words: he has therefore given
quite a different turn to the words of Thuc. in these two vss.; he
certainly does not refer to the sentence here quoted by Wak. ε his trans-
lation of it comes later, as we shall see. 1158 art-rius anyer occurred
above 111 993. 1160 Sinqultas frequens represents Thucydides' λὺγξ

nothing is brought up. 1101 Corripere ‘to draw together in spasm’ ·.
