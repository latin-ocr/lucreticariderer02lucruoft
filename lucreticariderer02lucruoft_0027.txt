latter more highly than that of the former. Or Quintus may have
dwelt on Lucretius' philosophical qualities 3 and Cicero who is continually
jeering at Epicurus for his want of art and scientific discipline, may
possibly include Lucretius in the same condemnation. However that
may be, if Cicero did deny him iozyenium, then did the great Roman
orator display less taste than the orator and philosopher of Arles
Favorinus two centuries later when, as Gellius 1 21 records, he spoke of
Lucretius as poetae inqenio et facundia praecellentia—But Ι cannot help
suggesting, what I have long suspected, that the corruption does not lie
in the words cited above, but in those which follow. The short letter thus
concludes according tothe mss: Lucretii poemata ut scribis ita sunt multis
luminibus ingenii multae tamen artis sed cum veneris virum te putabo si
Salustii Empedoclea legeris hominem non putabo. The sentence seems
to me clearly to require something to be joined with virum te putabo,
in order to contrast with si Salustii cet.: this now would be a very easy
correction, Lucretii poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt, multis luminibus
ingenii: multae tamen artis esse cum inveneris, virum te putabo 3 si
Salustii Empedoclea legeris, hominem non putabo: it is manifest how
easily the es of esse might be absorbed in the is of artis5 the in of
inveneris in the m of cum. Marcus would then mean to say: on a first
perusal you have rightly seen that there is much genius in the poem of
Lucretius. If when you have had time to study him, you discover much
of art as well, I shall think you a right worthy man, if you can get to
the end of Sallust's Empedoclea, I shall not think you a human being at
all. This would give the proper antithesis between vir and homo 3 and
would strengthen the probability that Marcus was editor. Bergk conjec-
tures that some words have fallen out and that we are to read: Lucretii
poemata ut scribis ita sunt: multis luminibus ingenii, ηοη multae tamen
artis, sed si ad zcmbilicum veneris, virum te putab03 si cet. This has
found favour with many 3 but I cannot approve of it. Whichever of the
two was editor, it would have been preposterous in the one to address
the other in this way 3 and how could Quintus have written in such
terms without having read the poem, a poem after all of 7000 verses?
Catullus, though it was published so short a time, scarcely a year
perhaps, before his death must I think have known it, when he wrote
his marriage of Peleus and Thetis, as he has there imitated it in more
places than one3 from which Ι infer that this poem of Catullus was one
of his latest: on this point compare the passages brought together in the
note to 111 57. When the nature of things was published, Virgil was
fifteen years of age. At such an age therefore the style and manner of
Lucretius were able to impress themselves fully on the younger poet's
susceptible mind3 and perhaps the highest eulogy which has ever been
passed on the former is that constant imitation of his language and
thought which pervades Virgil’s works from one end to the other.
