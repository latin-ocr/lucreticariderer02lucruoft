he quotes a passage from an old tragediam probably Ennius, to which
possibly Lucr. may here refer, Unde animae emittantur obscura umbra,
aperto em ostio Altae Acheruntis, falso sanquine, mortuorum ivmyines, as
it is read in Baiter and Halm's ed.: Ennius may have got the word
himself from Epicharmus: frag. B 7 Lorenz ἅνω τὸ πνεῦμα διαμενεῖ κατ
οὐρανόν; Sen. epist. 57 7 has permanere 3 76 25 manent in the same sense.
It may be said that with Ennius the soul did not dissolve: that is so 3
but it went into another body and entirely changed its condition3 and
Ennius no doubt thought of the dissolution of the old body and soul as
complete. With Quo perman. i.e. usque ad Acher. templa, Lach. com-
pares several passages: Ovid ars 11 120 Solus ad extremos permanet ille
roqos is perhaps the most 111 point: comp. too Vitruv. 111 praef. 2 aeterua

geor. 1 477 repeats the very words: comp. Homer's βροτῶν εἴδωλα κα-
μόντων. 124 Ennius ann. 6 Visus Homerus adesse poeta is a fragm. of
this vision: Cicero more than once infers from these words that it was a
dream, not a real vision. sem. flora: Ov. met. VII 702 semper florentis

refer back to 54 foll.: we must not only rightly explain the system
of heaven and the nature of the gods, in order to rid men of their fear
of them3 but likewise the real nature of the soul and of those images

punishment, or believe like Ennius that ghosts can come back to visit
the earth. 128 meatus, a favourite word of his: V 76 solis cursus
szaeque meatus. 130 tum eum: tuuc eum AB; also 111 710, VI 250
both have tuuc before a consonant, but nowhere else: Lach. therefore,
as F lor. 31 Camb. before him, properly reads tum after the usage of
older writers: see also WVagner quaest. Virg. xxv 5: tune before a
consonant is common in Livy and the silver age. 132 Et quae res
