6 INTRODUCTION

difference‚ would have truly been to twist a rope out of sand : of course
I am speaking of these two systems as they were in the days of Cicero
and Lucretius 3 though much the same might be said of them in the age
of their first propounders. Well then the stoical‘! I unhesitatingly assert
that ¹for all purposes of poetry both its physical and ethica] doctrines are
incomparably inferior to those of Epicurus. Read the de natura deorum;
compare their one wretched world, their monotonous fire, their rotund
and rotatory god, their method of destroying and creating anew their
world, with the system of nature unfolded by Lucretius, grand and.
majestical in its general outline, with some strangely suggestive antici-
pations of the latest marvels of physical science. Then look at their sterile
wisdom and still more barren virtue with their repudiation of all that con-
stitutes the soul of poetry. Lucretius on the other hand can preach up
virtue and temperance and wisdom and sober reason with as loud a voice
as any of your stoics 3 and then what inexhaustible resources does he leave
himself in his alma Venus and dum vitae dia voluptas! Are examples
wanted? then contrast the varied graces and exuberant beauty of Virgil,
when he is pleased to assume the garb of an epicurean, with the leaden
dulness and tedious obscurity of the stoic Manilius 3 or compare the rich
humour and winning ways and ease of a Horace with the hardness and
thinness and forced wit of a Persius, All this it may be said is in the
men, not their systems, Yes, but the proper choice of a subject is half
the battle. And yet the picturesque English historiari speaks of the epi-
curean as the meanest and silliest of all systems 3 and one German critic
after another sees fit to denounce it as beneath contempt. In this as in
many other points the poet has received more justice at the hands of
his latest English critic, and from the brilliant rhetoric of Martha in
his Lucrece. Lessing in his essay to prove that Pope because a poet
could not be a metaphysician says ‘if I am asked whether I know
Lucretius, whether I know that his poetry contains the system of
Epicurus, I would confidently answer‚ Lucretius and the like are verse-
makers not poets' 3 and again ‘the poet speaks with Epicurus, when he
would extol pleasure, and with the porch, when he would praise virtue '.
But this is what Lucretius can and does do: virtue at all events he
can praise on the broad grounds accepted by the general feeling of the
world, if he is unable to adopt the narrow and intolerant views of his
adversaries.

Lucretius possessed indeed in as high a degree as any Latin poet
two qualities which a poet can ill dispense with, the power of vividly
conceiving and of expressing his conceptions in words. This has enabled
him to master the great outlines of the epicurean universe of things, and
by a succession of striking images and comparisons drawn from the
world of things which was going on before the eyes of him and his
readers to impress this outline on their minds. The two first books
