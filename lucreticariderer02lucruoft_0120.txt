1021—102'7 are repeated with some changes V 419—-429 and 187—
194. It is mere blind chance, not providence, that has arranged out of
the atoms this world and other worlds 3 therefore these atoms never
could have thus combined, unless there was an infinite supply. 1021
for these three abls. see 11. 130 183. 1022 suo monosyl. here and v
420: 30 111 1025 sis oculis after Ennius3 who, ann. 278, has suos a
monos, 3 as is the abl. mieis in corp. inscr. 1 38 : the old titulus Mummi—
anus ib. 542 has in one v, Visum animo suo perfecit tua pace roqans te ζ,
though tua pace may be for tuam pacem ; but such a syniz. is rare in
hexameters, frequent in dramatic poetry: even Sen. Agam. 250 has
suapte dissyl. and Troad. 191 manibus meis debitos. 1024 mutata
refers of course only to change of place, as 911 eadem paulo inter se
mutata; 913 I nter se paulo mutatis sant elementis 3 681 mutarique ordine

word 111 this sense. 1026 Omne yenus: Lucr. is very fond of this
idiom, common in the best writers: qnod 9enus also occurs often ; and
v1 917 Hoc yenus in rebus: an adj. omniyenus is unknown to hi1n; see
n. 130 683. motus and coetus are of course acc. plur. 1027 disposi-

1028 partly recurs v 194. 1029 maqnos aomos: v 644 Quae volvunt
maquos iu magnis mensibus annos. There is no doubt an allusion,
perhaps sarcastic, to the stoical theories of the maynus annus, or cycle:
in each of these great years the world went through precisely the same
changes from its first formation to its ecpyrosiS. St-ob. eclog. 1 264
tells us that Heraclitus reckoned this year at 18,ΟΟΟ, Diogenes the
stoic at 365 times 18‚000 solar years. The poet then means to say, this
world, though its term of existence is nothing compared with the eternity
of the universe, yet in its present form outlives many of your great
years. 1031 [avicl. mare: Hor. od. 1 28 18.] fluminis undis is the
stream of water belonging to each amnis: see Forc. and Aen. 11 305

sense common in Caesar and Livy: summittere subsidia, auxilia, praesidia
and the like 3 and indicates a supply sent up when needed: amissa
