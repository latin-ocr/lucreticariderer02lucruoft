BOOK VI NOTES 11 375

what the eruption is or whether it is the same to which the two refer,
I do not know.

647—6'79: to understand such eruptions‚ reflect that our world is a
smaller fraction of the universe than a man is of the whole world: now
we are not surprised when a man is seized with any one of numerous
diseases, the seeds of which our world supplies ; why then wonder that
out of the universe should rise up the seeds of these or any other great
natural convulsions‘l if you say the conflagration is here too great to
comprehend, I reply that its rarity only makes it so appear; as we are
creatures of habit, and wonder at what is strange and cease to wonder
at what is common. 649 summam rerum has here its proper force:
see n. to 11008. profundam: see n. to 1v 63. 651 multesima pars
is quoted by Nonius p. 136, as ‘nove posita': Lucr. has formed it on the
analogy of millesimus, with the sense of πολλου-τός. 652 tota pars,
quota is found in Manil. 111 420: tolus is a very rare word having the
same relation to quotus, that totiens has to quotiens. 653 contueare
means perhaps the act of examining, and videas the seeing and under-
standing which thence results3 otherwise the phrase would be very
tautological. 660 comp. 1167 ut est per membra sacer dum clielilur
iqnisj, Celsus v 28 4 sacer quoque ipsuis malis ulceribus adnumerari
debet3 116 proceeds to describe at length two kinds: above, 28 31 and 33,
he had described what ἐρυσίπελας Graeci nominarim so that if the latter
correspond to our erysipelas, the sacer ipsuis must be different: Celsus by
sacer iffliis appears to understand one kind of the ἔρπης of the Greek
physicians ; others certainly make 113 to be erysipelas, as Isidore orig. 1v
8 4 erysipelas esc quem Latini sacrum ignem appellant, iel est eaeecrandum
per antiphrasim. 665 Sic iyitur cet. : as this world is sufficient to
supply endless disorders to man, so can the whole universe furnish the
materials for endless disorders to our world, such as earthquakes, vol-
canic eruptions and the like. 666 Ea: inf cet.: 1 996 suppeditantur

copia posset. 669 19. ab. Aeliu: Sen. nat. quaest. 11 30 Aetna ali-
quando multo ique abundavit. flammescere is found in no other writer
of authority. flam. cael: Aen. 111 574 Attollitque 9l0b0s flammarum
et sidera lambit: but flammescere caelum and ardescunt caelestia templa
strike me as somewhat frigid hyperboles in what is intended for a philo-
sophical description, as no one could take the flaming heaven to be
anything more than a mere ocular deception3 unless indeed Lucr. refer
to something like what Seneca l. l. records of the eruption of Aetna:
illo tempore aiunt tunc plurima fuisse tonitrua et fulmina quae concursu
aridorum corporum facta suut, nori nubium quas verisimile est i‘n tanto
fervore aeris nullas fuisse. The ‘caelum ardere visum' was common
among the ancient prodigies and may have inspired a traditional terror.
671 coortu: this word, which occurs 11 1106, is also Lucretian. 6¹72
