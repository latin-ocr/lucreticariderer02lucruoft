then you must give to these human feelings, in order that they may
make a man—This passage in meaning and in language greatly re-
sembles 803-829: the reason is plain: the particles of Anaxagoras
seemed to Lucr. liable to the same objections as the four elements of
Empedocles, each giving to his elements those secondary qualities which
only belong to things in being. 900 flam. flore: editors comp. πυρὸς

the properties of fire. 904 facta, fully made, opposed of course to the
semina, which might in other circumstances form water or anything else:

Ziynum: because here fire coming from wood is the question 3 in 820
caelum mare terras cet. because there it is the four elements that is
the subject examined. 915—920 here again he closes a long discus-
sion with a short argument appealing to common sense to shew to what
absurdities such premisses might lead: see 701 foll. 759 foll. 984 (998)

to what he deems the last absurdity, that of endowing first-beginnings
with human feelings. And, if a tree cannot produce fire without having
fires latent, why should a man be able to lau gh or cry, if he have not in
him laughing and crying elements2 ΜΙ- Poste of Oriel in a valuable
communication to me points out that I did Lucretius injustice in
making him put this argument into Anaxagoras’ mouth: ‘Lucu' he
says ‘does not charge Anaxag. with being bound to hold that all
ἀνομοιομερῆ were composed of similar parts: such a charge would not
be true: he only says that in the ἀνομοιομερῆ Anaxag. concedes the
principle that a thing may be conlposed of ingrediente unlike rosels,
and asks why then shall we not believe that the miscalled ὁμοιομερῆ
are actually so composed’. Aristotle, as Mr Poste observeS, indthe
part. anim. 11 1, p. 647 a, 2-14, makes the sensories ὁμοιομερῆ, and
prob. therefore Anaxag. did the same. However so far as I know
there is no evidence as to what Anaxag. did hold on this point: but
