Lucretius means to say in his poetical language is this: so far from men
and other animals requiring special sensible elements‚ they like every
thing else on earth come from the mingling of the elements of ether and
earth 3 and at their death these senseless elements return whence they
came, to be employed afresh in producing other things : the elements are
the same, it is only their motions arrangements etc. which make the dif-
ference: he then adds 1115 favourite illustration from the letters of the
alphabet. I should not say, as Zeller does from this single passage,
‘hence Epicurus shares the stoic belief in a divine origin of the human
race.'

991 oriundi: a very rare example of ἰζ altogether suppressed, with
scarcely a parallel in the hexameter poets: abiete (triete abieynifluviorum
principium consilium and the like, wherei has the power of a consonant,
are common enough; but for instances like ours Lach. in his learned
note has to go to the old scenio poets; and his examples are vehemently
controverted by Ritschl prise. Latin. epigr. suppl. 111 p. XXI: but L.
Mueller de re metr. p. 249 gives do‘offlnid from Lucilius, operiuntur from
Laevius, melius from Varro, as instances of z‘ wholly suppressed, as here.
996 Pabula cum praebet: it is said to give birth to man and beast by
giving them food, without which parent first and then child could not
exist a moment. The poet strives to find sufficient pretext for calling
earth mother. 999-1001 quoted by Lactant. inst. v11 12, who taxes
Lucr. with inconsistency‚ ‘sed victus est veritate'. 999 Cedit cet:
Ὅθεν δ’ ἕκαστον εἷς τό σῶμ’ ἄφίκετο, Ἐνταῦθ’ οἷπελθεῖν, πνεῦμα μὲν πρὸς
αἰθέρα, Τὸ σῶμα δ’ εἰς γῆν, says Eur. suppl. 533, or else Moschion:
Epieh. p. 258 Lorenz Συιέκρίθη καὶ διεκρίθη κᾶπῆλθεν ὅθεν ἦλθεν πάλιν,
γᾶ μὲν εἰς γᾶν, πνεῦμα δ’ ἄνω; but Anaxag. himself, fr. 8 Schorn and
Mullach, τὸ μὲν πυκνὸν καὶ διερὸν καὶ ψυχρὸν καὶ ar& ζοφερόν ἐνθάδε
συνεχώρησε, ἔνθα νῦν ή γῆ· τὸ δὲ οἷραιόν καὶ τό θερμὸν καὶ τὸ ξηρὸν καὶ
τὰ λαμπρὸν ἐξεχώρησε ἐς τό πρόσω τοῦ αἰθέρος. 1001 rellatum, but
V 686 relatus: corp. inser. 200 81 rellatum, and Ter. Phorm. 21 [and
Accius Didascalicon 11 1 2 Mueller]: 1v 761 116 5661115 to have written
Remota, which is lengthened by Lucilius also: reliyio relicuus stand of
course on a different ground, as the verse requires the first syll. to be
long: 566 n. to 1 560. 1002 foll. hear Anaxagoras himself frag. 17
Schorn and Mullach, 22 Schaubach, τὸ δὲ γίνεσθαι καὶ ἀπόλλυσθαι οὐκ

ἂν ὀρθῶς καλοῖεν τό τε γίνεσθαι συμμίσγεσθαι καὶ τὸ ἀπόλλυσθαι δια-
