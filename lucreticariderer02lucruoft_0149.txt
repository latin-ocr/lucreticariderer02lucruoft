ἰδέαι or εἴδη, which Aristotle interprets by σχήματα, sometimes to the
shapes of atoms, sometimes to the atoms themselves. 388 cornum, a
form found in Varro Ovid Gellius and others: [see Ussing to Amph.

fiquris and inplexis principiis: their being hamata makes them also
perplicata. 397 cuiusque seems to me to be used to increase the
antithesis: the several elements of any 011 in relation to the several
openings of any particular strainer: though Bruno’s conj. is ingenious,

398—407 : honey and milk are pleasant to the taste, wormwood and
the like nauseous 3 the former therefore consist of smooth, the latter of
jagged atoms which tear a way into the body. 401 Centauri : IV 125
and Virg. geor. lv 270 have the form centaurea3 the mss. of Pliny who
often uses the word appear to give centaurion or centaurium for the
nomin: the latter is the form used here: it appears not to be extant
in Greek. absinthi, Aeqi, conchyli are similar genitives of Greek
words in Lucr. pertorquent appears not to be found elsewhere:
the nomin. is natura twice repeated: this is less harsh than 111 558:

lecta 3 Lucilius⁷ quo eam: this prosody is exceedingly common in the
old scenio poets, but there the non-elision takes place always, or nearly
always, in the arsis of the foot. [Lucilius in his iambics and trochees
has also the old scenio usage: XXVIII 19 Lucili, εἴ in amore 3 XXVI 85

with IV 615 foll. it would be worth while to compare Theophrastus de

Democr. p. 217 foll. where it is explained at length out of what kind of

severally formed according to Democritus.

408-443 : also what is pleasing or offensive to the other senses, to
the hearing smell sight, must be formed of elements more or less smooth
or rough respectively: again some bitter flavours have elements, not
hooked, but slightly prominent: those of fire and cold are jagged, but in
different ways as shewn by touch, every bodily sensation being a kind of
touch. 408 Omnia postr.: passing from taste to the other senseS.
tactu is here the dat. of tactus ; and is quite synon. with sensibus, as it
