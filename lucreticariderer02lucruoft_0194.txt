what precedes Epic. 1. 1. 67 καθ’ ἑαυτὸν δὲ οὐκ ἔστι νοῆσαι τό ἀσώματον
πλὴν ἐπὶ τοῦ κενοῦ· τὸ δὲ κενὸν οὔτε ποιῆσαι οὔτε παθεῖν δύναται, ἀλλαῖ
κίνησιν μόνον δι’ ἑαυτοῦ τοῖς σώμασι παρέχεται· ὥσθ’ οἱ λέγοντες ἀσώμα-
τον εἶναι τὴν ψυχήν ματαΐζουσιν ου’θὲν γὰρ ἂν ἐδύνατο ποιεῖν οὔτε πάσχειν,
εἰ ἦν τοιαύτη· νῦν δ’ ἐναργῶς ἀμφότερα ταῦτα διαλαμβάνομεν περὶ τήν

177—230: the animus consists 01 very small round atoms, which
can move with extreme celerity and ease 5 sor nothing is so swift as
thought : 01 visible things those which move most easily, as water, are
composed 01 very small round elements : those of the animus then must
be eminently subtle. Again the fineness and smallness 01 the substance
01 the animus and anima are shewn by this : after death, when they have
left the body, it is not perceptibly diminished in size or weight ; you
may compare it with wine whose flavour is gone, or the like: the ele-
ments which compose this flavour are very minute3 and their absence
does not lessen the weight and bulk 01 the wine. 1'7'7 animus: it
will be seen, by comparing 208 eius with 212 animi natura animaeque
and the rest 01 the section, that here too he includes the anima in· the
term animus 3 though it is not till 421 that he tells us that when he uses
one word he intends to comprise the other as well, where the one is not
expressly distinguished from the other. It is his general practice, as we
have often seen, to keep distinct similar words, when his argument
requires· it3 to use them indifferently, when precision is not called
for. corpore is here used in its most general sense for material sub-
stance. 178 Constiteritzconstet: see n. to I 420. 184 res ulla. .
