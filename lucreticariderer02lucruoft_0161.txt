more will be said 011 11118 question: that Epicurus and Lucr. firmly be-
lieved in the existence of these gods is certain, how this immortality and
supreme felicity can be reconciled with the rest of their philosophy, it
were vain to ask 3 for no answer could be given. Did the gods exist
from all eternity‘l or had they a beginning? The words of Ennius trag.

epithet to natura, not 10 1116 substantive depending on it: see n. to 1
281 mollis aquae natura ; and comp. also 1 962 haec sensus natura. divom
natura seems to be a mere periphrasis for clivi, as 1 194 viatura animan-
tum for animantes: comp. too natura aquae, mundi, (mimi, animae,

Bacchi cum flos evanuit: but in these verses he doubtless points at the
stoics who carried allegory of this kind 10 611 absurd length: see what
the 81010 Balbus says in Cic. de nat. deor. ΙΙ 50 foll. Every part of
heaven and earth was thus parcelled out among 1116 gods and demigods,
and fatuous derivations assigned to their names by Zeno Cleanthes

with animum, so that it = ipse suum animum: so Aen. XI 544 Ipse sinu
prae se portans 3 and so ipse manu often 111 Virgi1= sua manu. It may
denote the real man in contrast with his empty words: the exact force
of ipse is often easier felt than expressed. 658—660 (652—654) see
notes 13 and for 611 explanation of this transposition see vol. 1 p. 29.

from Oicero3 but the best mss. of the auctor ad Heren. 1v 57 have
potitus est ylorz'ctm: this constr. is very common in the fragments of the
old tragic writers 3 and the auctor belli Africae has it 4 01· 5 1111168,
