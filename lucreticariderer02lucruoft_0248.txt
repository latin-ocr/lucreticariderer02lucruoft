has force by being thus placed at the beginning instead of after quae;
they are exceedingly small and therefore the propulsion is easier: the
ambiguity in parvola causa was quite indifferent to Luer.: see n. to 1 57
perempta and to v 1414 res illa reperta—parvola must then=tenuis-
sima 3 as if the poet only thought of their thinness, and of no other
dimension. But Prof. Mayor says ‘they have at their back a slight
cause, not too violent which might destroy them, i.e. succeetling images’.
Here again, as above, the immense difficulties of the theory seem to occa·
sion a vagueness in the poet's·mind and therefore his language; if indeed
we have his own words complete. Ι have often thought myself of a
hiatus: Susemihl Ι see assumes a v. to be lost between parvola and
causa: Ι have thought too of praevia (i.e. simulacra) for parvola.

causa: the cause behind which impels them is the body from which they
come constantly emitting from the surface images, as the sun discharges
light; this therefore is to be compared with 189 Suppeditacur cet.

cited to 179. 197 quaeris must not be too much pressed‚ as if it
meant all things without exception: they can enter, not necessarily pass
through, hard things, even wood and stone, though they may get
broken in them. But then the necessity of his theory compels him to
devise the curious explanation in 150 of things at once hard and bright
throwing the images back. 198 permanare, stream clear through, not
merely penetrare. 203 riqare: v 593 Tantalus ille queat tantum sol
mittere lumen, Quod maria ac terras omnis caelumque riyando Gompleat
et calido perfundat cuncta vapore: the repetition of caelum in our vss. is
harsh 3 but the mare ac terras made it almost inevitable, and such repe-
titions are in the manner of Lucr. and the old writers. 204 iyitwr:

the sense you want is not simply ‘don't you see they ought to travel
faster'l', but ‘don't you see they ought to travel immensely faster'l’ 3
and why should the common formula nonne vides have been altered?
Quo is for quanto as so often in the best writers: sometimes ‘ne is
annexed to the relative, as in Catull. 64 180 quemne ipsa reliqui? i.e.
patrisne quem reliqui& 183 Quinefuqit? i.e. coniugisne qui fugit'lz but
here Quo is the interrogative and more resembles Plaut. cist. 1v l 1
