324-3502 if the world had no beginning, why did history coni-
mence with the wars of Thebes and Troy? nay the world began but
lately, and so arts and sciences are still in progress: if it be said all
these existed before, but were destroyed by some great catastrophe, then
you inust the more admit that the world will come to an end: when it
suffered so grievously, had the causes been more powerful, it must have
perished altogether 3 thus we all know we shall die, because we have
the same diseases as those who are already dead. 326 fun. Tra: Hor.

to 111 700 ε the argument for the final destruction of the world is
stronger than the one for its having had a beginning; because if it be liable
to such terrible diseases‚ one of these must some day be mortal according

to all analogy. 346 incubuisset: so vl 1143 of the plague Incubuit

351—379: again that which is everlasting must either be impene-
trable like atonis, or intangible like void, or must have nothing without
it into which it can pass or out of which destructive forces can come 3
and this is the case with the universe: but we have shewn that not one
of these conditions is true of our world3 it is therefore doomed to de-
struction, and therefore it had a beginning too 3 for being mortal‚ it
could not have lasted from eternity. 351 necessust: see n. to 11 710:
