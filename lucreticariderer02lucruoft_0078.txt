the soul is not immaterial, because then it could not ποιεῖν οὔτε πάσ-
χειν; νῦν δ’ ἐναργῶς σῘμφότερα ταῦτα διαλαμβάνομεν περὶ τήν ψυχὴν τσῖ

and yet the latest authorities such as Zeller and Ussing continue to
distinguish the two terms. Galen also again and again uses them as
synonymes 3 as Method. Med. I 8 ἕτερόν τι γένος εἴτε συμπτωμάτων εἴτε
συμβεβηκότων εἴθ’ ὅπως ἂν ἄλλως ἐθέλῃ τις ὀνομάζειν. [450 ea: for this
position in the sentence see Ussing to Plaut. Amph. 181.] 451 per-
mitiali: permities permitialis permitiabilis are quite distinct in origin,
and differ perhaps in meaning from pernicies perniciosus: whether per-
nicialis or perniciabilis exists I cannot say 3 but Conington, Virgil vol. 3
p. 223, is mistaken in supposing that I did not believe in the existence of
pernicies, perniciosus. There is overwhelming evidence however for per-
mities, etc.: they are found in the best mss. of Plautus, Livy, Tacitus3
in the palimpsest and two other of the best of Pliny xv 74: Nonius,
p. 153 and 218, assigns a permities to Plautus, Accius and Lucilius: in
Sen. Agam. 229 the permitti of the Florentine attests permitiem: again
Donatus ars gramm. 11, p. 392 Keil, says ‘per inmutationem litterae ut
olli pro illi, syllabae ut permities pro pernicies', attesting both the m and
t, as otherwise it would not be syllabae but litterae. permiti-es seems to
imply ‘utter destruction', ‘annihilation'z pernicies and perniciosus are
prob. connected with noceo: see Corssen 11 p. 422: we say perniciosae
leqes3 and in our passage ‘sine pernicioso Discidio' would ill express
Lucretius’ meaning. See F ick vergl. Woerterb. 1 p. 153, 3 mi etc. who
compares with various Sanscrit words μινύω μινύθω μείων, minus minuo
ete, and Corssen krit. Beitr. p. 266 foll.: permities therefore will signify
‘a wasting away to nothing' : Fick l. l. p. 470 ‘with the form —tya comp.
