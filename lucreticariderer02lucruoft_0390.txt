conjectures that the short u is due to the Roman soldiers confounding
the end of the word with one of their own diminutiveS. But as in the
age of Lucr. a Roman soldier was incapable of making a false quantity
in his own language, I am unwilling to assume his being guilty of the

’ἱ of silva, was short by nature, and as in Il. E 708 and H 221 the Boeo-
tian and therefore Aeolian ’Ύλη has ὕ, the old Greek word in question
may well have been σῦλα. Qualis cet. depends on Nonne vides of course.
