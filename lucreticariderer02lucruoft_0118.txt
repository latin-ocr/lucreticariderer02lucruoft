110 BOOK I NOTES II

1008—1051: and the sum of things and matter too are infinite: the
other question proposed above : for space being infinite, if matter were
finite, then nothing in being could exist one moment: this world for
example and all its parts would dissolve into their atoms ς or rather
could never have existed 3 for it is only by an infinite supply of matter
that this earth and heaven can be maintained: the mutual clashings of
atoms might keep this world, or any other world, supplied for a time 3
but only for a time: nay without infinite matter even these clashings
could not go on. 1008 reram summa: see n. to 235, and 333. summa
is with Lucr. a very indfflnite term : we have seen that summa omnis,
summa summai totius omnis, summa summarum and the like are all
synonymes of the omne or universe: summa loci is the infinite void or
space: as then res is his proper term for things in being, summa rerum
denotes the whole sum of things in being, the whole number numberless
of worlds in being throughout infinite space, even as haec ‘rerum summa
means this world of ours : and this is its regular and usual meaning, as
502 U nrlc omnis rerum nanc constet summa creata, and 11 530 Ea> infinito
summam ‘rerum usque tenere. But then as this summa rerum is infinite,
and as the first-beginnings, out of which it comes and into which it passes
back, are also infinite, and as worlds somewhere in the universe are
always rising into being and perishing, and thus the relations between
the res ancl the primordia are constantly changing ; the infinity of res and
that of primordia got mixed together so inextricably, that sometimes, as
in our present passage, samma reram means the whole infinite sum of
matter, both things in being and atonis out of which they come: some-
times, as 1 334, samma rerum is as vague as its cognate natura rerum5
see also n. to 619. Once, vl 606, as the context fixes the meaning, he
ventures to use rerum summa for hacc rerum summa or hic mundus 3
while 649 it has again its most extensive sense. 1009 N e possit,
