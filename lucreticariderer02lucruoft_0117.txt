atonis: a claim no broader than the claim made by Newton. . ,and at first
sight much more conceivable: at first sight only, for indeed atoms
pour-ing onward, as imagined by our author, could be no source of power.
Motion in mechanics has no meaning except as denoting a change of
relative position: all atoms moving, as Lucretius fancied, at one speed
and in parallel lines would relatively to one another have been in perfect
rest...Lucr. unconsciously assumed tlze world as bis basis by which to
measure direction and velocity’. When by the artifice spoken of, 11 216
foll„ atoms were enabled to clash and combine, both Epicurus and Lucr.
conceived the rising up of atoms in a direction more or less contrary to
the only natural motion as that which enabled things to come into being
and remain in being, and rendered possible the existence and mainte-
nance of the summa rerum. It is utterly vain for Lach. to attempt to
controvert this: comp. the words of Epic. quoted in p. 111, τοὶ ὑπερείδον-
τσ. καὶ στέλλοντα κατοὶ τὰς ἀντικοπάς, of Which Lucretius' inf supp. cet. is
the paraphrase 3 comp. too 1035 foll. I am compelled to be thus diffuse
owing to the strange way in which Lucretius' words and my own have
been misunderstood. Of course from the nature of the case Lucretius'
conception of inferna, ‘from beneath’, implied every kind of motion up-
wards, whether perpendicularly or obliquely upwards, all of which would
have more or less of a sustaining power in opposition to the inherent
downward tendency. Take once more Epicurus’ own words l. l. 61,
where 116 is speaking of his atoms moving freely, when nothing impedes,
οὔθ’ ἦ ἅνω οὔθ’ ἦ εἷς τὸ πλάγιον διὰ τῶν κρούσεων φοροῖ οὔθ’ ἦ κάτω διὰ τῶν
ἰδίων βαρῶν. 1001 and 1036 Ex infinito i.e. spatio, as V 367 Eoo in-

414 Ex infinito fuerat quaecumque coorta: but 1 1025 Ex infinito=Ex
inf. tempore 3 which in the similar passages v 188 and 423 is expressed,
Ex infinito iam tempore percita playis: so indifferent is Lucr. to such
ambiguities. Em infinito appears from 1036 Ex inf suboriri, and v1 666
Ex infinite...suppeditare, to depend on suppeditantur, but perhaps it re-
fers to cita as well. cita has its full participial force, as also 11 85 cum
cita saepe and lv 546 reyio cita: so Hor. epod. 9 20 Puppes sinistror-
sum citae. 1002 profundi is here a subst. as often in Lucr.: so nct-
tura, habenas, summam profundi: but he only thus uses it in the gen.

sophica] import.
