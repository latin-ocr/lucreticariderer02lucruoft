Lachmann's explanation 01 this last variation in notes 1 to 44—47 3 yet
I do not think that Lucr. who like other early writers repeats words and
phrases with 811011 indifference, would have hesitated as to a single word
compta with an interval of two vss.: the fact is qua constet compta fiyura
would have been here utterly out 01 place, because what he says about

often frighten us when sick or asleep: these We must not think to be
souls from hell, which have survived the dissolution 01 the body. 26
