represented as acting. But to say that the stars and the sun must move
from some one controlling cause, or that eclipses can admit of only one
explanation, or that lightning and clouds can be formed in only one way
is a vain unphilosophical assumption, since they are beyond our powers
of observation and there are many ways of explaining them equally pro-
bable, to which οὐδὲν τῶν φαινομένων ἀντιμαρτυρεῖ, or οὐθὲν τῶν ἐναργη-
μάτων διαφωνεῖ and the like: you must not then fear τοὶς ἀνδραποδώδεις
τῶν ἀστρολόγων τεχνιτείας; to give one explanation καθῆκόν ἐστι τοῖς
τερατεύεσθαί τι πρὸς τοὺς πολλοὺς βουλομένοις, nay it is μάταιον, and
even μανικόν. Well then all the possible reasons which Lucr. has just
given of the motion of the stars are equally unrefuted by sense; are
equally true therefore 3 and though only one of them may apply to our
world, yet in the countless worlds, like and unlike oum, existing in the
universe they all may and must find their place, 1. l. 94 ε’ἀν μή τις τὸν
μοναχῇ τρόπον κατηγαπηκὼς τοὺς ἄλλους ὠς κενοὺς ἀποδοκιμάζῃ, οὔ τεθεω-
ρηκὼς τί δυνατὸν α’νθρώπῳ θεωρῆσαι καὶ τί α’δύνατον, καὶ δια τοῦτ’ ἀδύνατα
θεωρεῖν ἐπιθυμῶν.

534-563; the earth remains at rest in the midst of the world,
because its weight gradually diiniiiishes and below it is another nature
closely connected with the air above the carth: thus the whole formsas
it were an organie whole, and one part does not weigh down another any
more than one member of the body another member, the whole having
been united and working together since its first formation: see too how
the light soul sustains and puts in motion the whole heavy body.

534 Terraque: Lucr. does not tell us what the shape of the earth is 3 but
he must have conceived it as presenting a surface more or less flat both
above and below, 535 Evanescere cet. i.e. below on the under-suriaco:
evanescere et decrescere, as 625 Evunescere, imminui, seems a decided
ὕστερον πρότερονε for the latter must have place before the former:
[comp. Caes. b. civ. 111 1 3 ad timoraem morarum tabularum tollendum
minuendumque] 538 vivit: see n. to 476 viva: yet it does
appear harsh to apply this epithet to the bruta terra, the model of Quid
sit vitali motu sensuque remotum: perhaps he was thinking of it as
forming a sort of organic body with the air, like the human body with
which he proceeds to compare it. Epic. in Diog. x 74 says merely καὶ ἤ γὴ·
τῷ οἷέρι ἐποχεῖταιε 111 xl of his περὶ φύσεως, col. 1, vol. Hercul. 11, he seems
to be speaking to the same purpose as Lucr. 3 but its condition leaves it
scarcely intelligible. Plut. de plac. phil. 111 15 assigns this notion to
Anaximenes: διδ. τὸ πλάτος ἐποχεῖσθαι τῷ ἅέρι. Pliny nat. hist. 11 10
gives an account much resembling that of Lucr.: spiritus quem Graeci
nostrique eodem vocabulo aera appellant, vitalem hunc et per cuncta
rerum meabilem totoque consertum, ; huius vi suspensam cum quarto
aquarum elemento librari medio spatii tellurem cet. A stoic might
perhaps have pointed to his fierce attack on their cosmica] system 1 1052
