BOOK 1 NOTEs 11 45

‘images or idols', εἴδωλα, which are shed from all things, not the
bloodless phantoms‚ which Ennius feigns to issue out of Acheron;
and which terrify us when sick or asleep. The constr. of this verse is
shewn by IV 33, which is the best comment on it, Atque eadem (simula-
cra) ‘nobis vigyilana'bus obvia mentes Terrfficaut atque in soumis, cum
saepe fiquras Contuimur miras simulacraque luce carentum: it is well
explained by N. P. Howard, J ourn. of philol. 1 p. 116, who observes that
somnoque sep. is a brachylogy for ‘et quae reS, nobis somno sepultis
obvia, mentes nostras per somnum terrificet⁷: the ‘vigilantibus obvia'
only of course affect us when under the influence of disease. The em-
phatic repetition of these horrid visions seen in sickness might seem to
confirm what is related of the poet being subject to fits of delirium, or
disordering sickness of some sort. A curicus comment on these Vss. and
Jerome's or Suetonius' assertion that Lucr. was ‘amatorio poculo in
furorem versus' is furnished by the same Suetonius in what he says
of Caligula lv 5O ‘creditur potionatus a Caesonia uxore amatorio quidem
medicamento, sed quod in furorem verterit. incitabatur insomnia
maxime, neque enim plus quam tribus nocturnis horis quiescebat, ac
ne iis quidem placida quiete, sed pavida miris rerum imaginibus': comp.

sepulti: used by Ennius before and Virgil after him. 135 repeated 1v

734, but there quorum begins the verse. Virg. Aen. X 641 has morte
obita and v 31 tellus...qremio complectitur ossa: Cicero also uses morte
obita. As he treats of the soul and these images so fully in ΙΙΙ and iv,
it might seem that the motives he here assigns are too narrow3 but like
a true disciple of Epicurus he wishes to persuade his reader or himself
that he discusses these questions not for their scientific interest, but to
free man from vain fears of the gods and death, and to produce that
tranquillity of mind, without which happiness is not possible: he reite-
rates the same just below, 146—158.

adjectives: pendere animi is in Cicer03 Plautus trin. 454 has Satin tu es

p. 136 says ‘neque Cicero neque Livius neque quisquam post comicos
et Lucretium (apud quem est animi fallit) genitivum illum adiunxit
nisi iis verbis, quae dubitationem et sollicitudinem significant.' 139 011
