212 BOOK 111 NOTES 11

n. to 1 441. Observe the poetical tautology with which in this pas-
sage after his usual fashion he enforces an important doctrine: certum
ac dispositumst, crescat et insit, sine corpore oriri Sola, in eodem homine
atque in eodem vase, certum Dispositumque, esse et crescere, dua-are
yenit-7203, diversius.. mayis disiunctum discrepitansque, inmortali atque
perenni. 820 ab rebus munita: Sallust Cat. 32 1 ab incendio intelle-
9ebat urbem viyiliis munitam3 Hor. od. 111 16 1 Danaen. ,munierwnt
satis Nocturnis ab adulteri33 Colum. xl 3 2 hortum ab incursu hominum
pecudumque unanimus-3 Livy xxn 1 3 sese ab insidiis munierat 3 [Caes.
b. civ. 11 9 5 tecta atque munita est ab omni ictu hostium ; auct. b. Alex.
78 2 provinciasque populi Romani α barbaris atque inimicis reyibus...
munivit] The sense admits of no question; but it may perhaps be a.
question whether the vitalibus ab rebus of mss. was not used by Lucr.
in the sense of letalibus with contemptuous allusion to the use of
vitalici as a euphemism for mortualia: Sen. epist. 99 22 quam multis
cum maxime florius locatur! quam multis vitalia emuntur! and Petron.
sat. 77 at end interim, Stiche, profer vitalia in quibus volo ‘me efferri,
and 42 bene elatus est, vitali lecto, stragulis bonis. 826 male habet:
Ter. Andr. 436 ltoc male habet virum 3 940 qui me male habet 3 hecyr.

habet multa callidus arte puer ; [Lucil. vn 20 Hanc ubi vult male habere, =
ulcisci pro scelere eius] 82¹7 ‘there is much force in Praet. male
adm„ if you compare suturis in 8252 not only present bodily suffering
(824), but fear of future suffering (825) ; and when evil deeds are past
ancl gone, remorse remains' J. E. M. Praet. adm. is the abl. abs.

830—869: thus the soul being proved to be mortal, death is nothing
to us 3 for as we felt no discomfort, when Rome and Carthage were war-
ring for the empire of the world, we shall feel none after the dissolution
of body and soul, though heaven and earth go to ruin: if our soul ⁴even
do exist after death, that is nothing to uS, whose identity consists in the
union of soul and body: or if infinite time to come collects again and
gives life to the very same atoms of which we consist, that is nothing to
us, when this identity has once been broken 3 even as we know and
remember nothing of our former selves, if as is probable infinite time
past arranged the atoms just as they now are in us: death will prevent
us from existing in that future time and feeling the ills that may befall
that repetition of ourselves z death then will at once make us for ever-
more as if we never had been. 830 foll. Epicurus to Menoeceus in
Diog. Laert. X 125 says τὸ φρικωδέστατον οὖν τῶν κακῶν ὁ θάνατος οὐθὲν
πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἐπειδήπερ ὅταν μὲν ἡμεῖς ὦμεν, ὁ θάνατος οὗ πάρεστιν, ὅταν
δ’ ὁ θάνατος παρῇ, τόθ’ ἡμεῖς οὐκ ἐσμέν. Both Lactantius and Bayle
