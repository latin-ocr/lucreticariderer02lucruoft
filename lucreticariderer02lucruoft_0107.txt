846 illi, Empedocles and the rest: see 734 foll. 848 Si prim. sunt,
sim. etc.: Anaxagoras gives to his partieles, frag. 3 Schorn, χροιαῖς καὶ
ἡδονάς, colour and taste 3 while Lucr. in 11 takes such pains to prove that
his atoms can have no secondary qualities: again frag. 16 Anaxagoras
says that as there can be no minimum, his particles cannot exist alone, ἀλλ’
ὅκως περὶ ἀρχήν, καὶ νῦν πάντα ὁμοῦ : to Lucr. an absurdity, who will only

reason from his own premisses. 850 neque [eas] refrenat : see n. to
718. 851 oppressu may be added to the words enumerated in n. to
653. 852 sub dent. : saucibus is a more common metaphor: Lamb.

quotes Arnob. 11 32 ‘non esse aoiimas Zonye ab hiatibus mortis et faucibus
constitutas 3 but Lucr. agrees better with our use of ‘jaws of death': join
‘in oppressu valido sub ipsis leti dentibus'. 859—866 a dilemma:
food supports the body: are the partiales ὁμοιομερῆ with the food? then
veins, blood etc. consist of what is not ὁμοιομερές with it : or if you say
that every kind of food has in it whatever the body has, bone vein blood,
then will meat and drink consist of particles not ὁμοιομερῆ with them :
again the poet’s own premisses assumed. Plut. de plac. phil. 1 3 proves
what effective use Anaxagoras must have made of the fact of food nourish-
ing at once all the parts of the body, so different from each other and
from the food itself. 863 omnino, to complete the list, go through all
the parts specified. 864 cibus om. including all nourishment, drink
as well as meat, et aridus cibus et liquor: ipse means ‘as well as dry
