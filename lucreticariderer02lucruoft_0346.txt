1136—1160: thus kings were overthrown, and anai-chy followed;
till nations weary of violence established laws and constitutions: then
fear of punishment restrained men, as injustice generally recoils on the
wrongdoer, and if lie escape punishment, he cannot escape the terrors of

conscience. 1136 Eryo req. occ.: because they had attained supreme

metuendus is so common ; but so it is with timeo horreo and some other
verbs of fearing. 1141 Res cet. I formerly took, as it is generally
taken, to mean ‘summa res' or ‘summa imperii ad infimum vulgus
redibat', a sense the words, as 1 shewed, could doubtless bear, and which
would accord with the common metaphorica] use of faex But now I see

artaque iura : in the former case these words are probably synonymes;
in the latter tautologica13 though of course ius has a wider meaning
than lex and includes all which is or ought to be legally right: Horace
too when he wrote Qui wnsulta patrum, qui {eyes iuraque servat, had
probably no accurate distinction in his mind between the la'st two words,
as iura comprises strictly speaking consulta, leqes and many other things
