559 Quod: for position in sentence see n. to v1 789. 560 relicuo:
this word, spelt sometimes reliquus, is always 4 Syll. in Lucr. and the
older writers, who refused to unite the last two syll: the first is only
lengthened by metrica] necessity, as it is short in metres which admit
that quantity, and was never lengthened after it became a trisyll.
Many, Virgil Horace etc, avoid the word: see Lach. p. 305: if Manil.

trisyll.: comp. v 679 Consequiss the principle of which is the same.

nendum cum constent ‚· illo enim niodo potius loquebantur antiqui': the
potius perhaps goes too far : yet Lucr. can use the indic. when, as here,
you can translate ‘when or while at the same time’: comp. 11 690 Cum

‘crem iunxit cum indicativo, quod M. Tullio et bonis scriptoribus

by the subjunctive and so keeping the indicative] possit reddizpossit

tion of 565—576 hear what Newton says in his optics p. 251 ‘all bodies
seem to be composed of hard particles: for otherwise fluids would not
congeal...Even the rays of light seem to be hard bodies...and therefore
hardness may be reckoned the property of all uncompounded matter...
Now if compound bodies are so very hard as we find some of them to
be, and yet are very porous and consist of parts which are only laid
together, the simple particles which are void of pores and were never
yet divided must be much harder. For such hard particles being heaped
together can scarce touch one another in more than a few points, and
therefore must be separable by much less force than is requisite to
