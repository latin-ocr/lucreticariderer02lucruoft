BOOK I NOTES 11 113

submisere Colchi Maius 3 sat. 11 4 43 Vinea submittit capreas uon semper
edules. 1034 vivant--durent by a poetical licence: see n. to v 538 :
a stoic or peripatetic could here use it 1iterally; but to the philosopher
Lucr. these things are rather an example, as he says v 125, of what is
vitali motu sensuque remotum. 1036 see n. to 1000. 1037 quaeque
is accus. agreeing with amissa. 1038 foll. comp. 11 1122 foll. 1039
am. cor.: 8ο 810 amisso iam corpore 3 1v 535 Nec te fallit item quid
corporis auferat: this use of corpus in the sense of ‘losing fiesh’, and
facere ‘gainjng flesh⁷ is found in Cicero: see lexicons: I have noted
from Ovid four instances, of which am. 1 6 5 Louqus amor tales corpus
tenuavit iu usus Aptaque subducto corpore membra dedit, is curious:
[see too Mart. lib. spect. 7 6 Inque omui nusquam corpore corpus erat]
1041 aversa viai, a grecism to which I know no exact parallel: Horace's
sceleris purus, operum solutis are somewhat like: and Wak. aptly com-
pares too his abstineto irarum calidaeque rimae and desine querellarum,
which stand almost or quite alone. [But Aen. x 441 desistere puynae:
comp. too Horace's laborum decipitur, requavit populorum, and neque
ille Sepositi ciceris uec louqae invidit avenae] Enn. ann. 209 viai seems
to depend not on flexere but quo. 1042 sum. oum. quaec„ the whole
of any sum of matter gathered together, such as our summa or mundus
here spoken of. 1044 Cadere, an expressive metaphor with playa or
ictus, to give the force of Epicurus’ ἅντικοπή, the counter—stroke which
makes the atom change its course and enables it to combine ε these vss.
illustrate the inferna supp. of 1000; the plaqae or collisions enable
atoms to change their directions, so that enough may come up in all
directions from beneath to keep any summa in being ,- but yet these
plaqae could not suffice without an infinite store of matter to supply
them in number sufficient. 1045 queatur : 111 1010 potestur: these
or other forms are common enough in the old writers3 as quitur quitast
nequitur nequitum poteratur possitur 5 but can only 100 used when
followed by an infin. pass. 3 as in the case of coeptus, desitus sum.

1049 comp. 1036. 1050 Et tamen: 1v 811 Et tamen iu rebus,- v 768
Et tamen ipsa suo cet.; 1177 Et tamen omuino quod cet.; 1096 Et
ramosa tamen cum cet. 3 1125 E't tamen e summo cet. 3 vl 603 E't tamen
interdum, etc.: the force of the particles is ‘and putting this or other
considerations out of the way, even then’, or ‘and yet after all', or the
like: see n. to v 1177.

1052-1082: do not believe with some that all things tend to a
centre, and therefore the world keeps together without external force,
and things and animals beneath the earth cannot tumble into the sky
any more than we can fly up to it : that our day is their night, their day
our night: this is sheer folly: there is no centre in infinity, and, if there
were, things would not be attracted any more than repelled by it: void
everywhere alike yields to all body alike—It is the stoics doubtless
