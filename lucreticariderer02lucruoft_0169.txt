like wood than a sensible to an insensible thing. adque B some six
times, A never: it seems to have become more common in the first
century and later from a false affectation of analogy: see n. to VI 92
praescribta. Wagner forces adque on Virgil in all cases, against the
overwhelming testimony of mss: Augustus however in his res gestae
writes adque the only time he uses the word3 but he also writes aliquod
for aliquot, perhaps from a notion of consistency: see vol. 1 p. 34 and
35. 883—885 repeated in substance 1007-1009.

886—930: the mind tries hard not to believe that sense can come
from what has not sense 3 for stones wood clods can by no mixture pro-
duce it: but, mind, it is not every clement that can beget sense 3 only
certain atoms with certain shapes ancl arrangements: yet even these woods
and clods may, as we have seen, give birth sometimes to living things.
But they who say that sense can only come from what has sense, suppose
elements to be soft, as we never see sense united but with what is soft:
now suppose such elements eternal3 they must have the sense of some part
or of the whole living thing: but no part can feel away from the whole
thing: well then these elements must be like the whole living thing: if
they are living then, they are thereby liable to death3 but even if they are
not, they would make a inere medley of living things, like the impossi-
ble unions of men and brutes: but if they lose their own sense, why
then give it only to take it away? nay we have just seen that sense can

come from what has no sense. 886 animum percutit seems a1most
proverbial: Ter. Andr. 125 Percussit ilico animum3 Cic. ad Att. 1v 8 b
3 audivi. . ‚Romae esse hominem.. . percussit animum. 887 varios sensus

i.e. varias sententias: it is very probable that his frequent use of sensus
with its primary meaning in this part of his poem has prompted him to
use it here, rather than avoid it, in a different signification: see n. to 1 875.
892 not out of all atoms alike which go to form things3 but only out of
certain very fine and smooth ones as proved elsewhere. 894 quantula,
because the atoms which go to produce sense ancl life are of the smallest
and finest kind. 896 quae sint i.e. qualia sint. 89¹7 Qu. nil rer.=
quorum nihil, a common constr.: Caes. bel. Gall. 111 4 3 quarum rerum
α nostris...fieri nihil poterat3 v 1 7 nihil earum rerum3 bel. civ. 1 7 7
quarum rerum nihil factum3 11 43 2 quarum rerum nihil : the opposite
constr. is also common : see n. to 111 184 res ulla...quorum. rerum
here has of course an abstract sense, ‘none of which conditions': comp.
1018 discrepitant res, and n. there. 901 Cone. ita ut debent i.e. Cone.
tali concilio quali debent: at first sight you might expect debeant, as
Lamb. suggests3 but the indic. i‘s quite idiomatic: Cic. ad. Att. 1v 5 1

essent, si cet. 3 vl1 2 3 adulescentem, ut nosti, i.e. talem qualem 3 lx 7
