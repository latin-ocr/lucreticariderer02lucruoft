amasse] '766 dissentit does not appear to occur elsewhere with this
constr.: ‘compounds often take the inf. or whatever constr. the simple
verb does, even where such a constr. seems unnatural in the new sense
which the compound has: sentit “feels''‚ dissentit “feels by way of objec-
tion'' “protests”: comp. 1088 repuynat’ J. E. M. : see 1 582 and n. there.
mortis letique, another curious tautology: comp. 274 duplici yeminoque,
451 Bina geminare. potitum, said of meeting with an evil, is illus-
trated by Forc. from Plautus Accius Terence and others: Plaut. capt.

vitutis: see Ussing there] '7¹71 perit: see n. to 111 1042: this ingenious
explanation resembles that given above 318—323 of the movements of
an image in a niirror: ‘there is a toy which exactly illustrates Lucr.: the
same figure in different positions is painted at intervals 10 or 11 times
over on a card, which is placed in a revolving cylinder. The effect is
that of very rapid motion through the whole series of positions' J. E. M.
7¹72 Inde statu: above Unde scias ; below Libera sponte 3 superbia spur-
citia5 even three consonants mollia strata, manantibus stillent 3 nay four
pendentibus structas. ¹775 sensibili quovis tempore in uno is Epicurus'
ἐν αἰσθητῷ χρόνῳ : see n. to 795 where the passage is quoted and illustrated3
795 is a paraphrase of the one word sensibili.

777—81'7: this question offers many difficulties: why does a man
think of whatever he wishes to think, sea or earth or sky? while others
in the same place have quite other thoughts: why too in sleep are these
images seen to move rhythmically‘l are they forsooth trained by art? or
is it that in the least sensible time many timos are latent, in which many
images can appear? the mind again, like the eye, in order to see must
often attend and exert itself, else they will pass unheeded: again the
mind adds many false inferences to what is see11.--818 foll. are immedi-
ately connected with the passage ending at 776 ; and our present para-
graph discusses the same questions as that passage sometimes in the
same, sometimes in a different spirit, without the least reference to it.
Lach. is therefore incontestably right in including this among those
subsequent additions which Lucr. made to his poem, but did not live to
incorporate fully with the rest. The poet is evidently embarrassed by
the prodigious difficulties which this theory of mental apprehension
involves and struggles hard to solve them: not content with the preced-
ing paragraph, he has tried to better his argument in this one. '779
quod depends on coyitare understood from coyitet: ie. cogitet id ipsum,
quod cogitare libuerit. ‘haec quaestio' says Lamb. ‘quare quod cuique
libuerit, id cogitet, cum cogitatio simulacris excitetur, pendet ex supe-

riore cet.': these words of Lamb. Havercamp with his usual diligence ¹

prints as a continuation of the words of Cicero cited just before 3 and
Wak. with a no less conscientious diligence remarks ‘locus etiam Cice·
ronis nat. deor. 1 quem Lambinus apposuit Lucretiano est consimillimus
