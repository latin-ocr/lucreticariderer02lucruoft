which it has in Arma virumque and Aen. 1v 3 Multa viri virtus. 372
privis, 389 priva, here and elsewhere in Lucr. are exact synonymes of
sinqula. 373 variare is of course neuter here, as often in Lucr.
This is another leading point of difference between Epicurus and Demo-
critus, and one we should not have known of but for this passage: Arist.
de anima 1 5 at beg. merely says of Democritus that his ψυχή is ἐν παντὶ
τῷ αἰσθανομένῳ σώματι, which would be quite as true of Epicurus', who
in many recorded points agreed with him on this question as on others,
such as making the soul consist of the smallest and roundest atoms.
3¹74 animae elementa: VI 7 55 Sed natura loci ope: comp. too Virg. geor.
11 144 tenent oleae armentaque laeta: the only two cases where Lucr.
lengthens by the caesura a short vowel, 11 27 and v 1049, occur likewise
in the middle of the fourth foot. minora, as proved at length 179—
230. 377 dumtaxat: see n. to 11 123. 379 Corpora are any of
these small external bodies, a grain of dust etc. ; whereas in corpore is
our body on which these fall: the word is thus used with his usual
indifference to ambiguity: see n. to 1 875. Then notice the prima of
378, which=an adv. whereas in -380 prima eae.=primordia; though from
the turn of the sentence, you would think there was an antithesis in
these two uses of prima, there being none whatever. There is thus no
occasion to read priva with Bentl. in these two places, which would then
give exordia by itself the force of primordia which it nowhere has in
Lucr. If a grain of dust touch the body without being felt, then the
distance between two atoms of the soul must be greater than this grain.

381 Nam cet.: Lucr. does not venture to say how few they are
compared with those of the body 3 but these instances prove he thought
the disproportion to be very great: the foot of a gnat or a grain of dust
touching the body must touch thousands and thousands of atoms: if
then these can often fall on the body without being felt, that is without
touching any atoms of the soul, these must be vastly fewer than those of
the body. But does not the body feel as well as the soul? yes 3 he has
elaborately proved already that the one feels as well as the other, and
that neither of the two can possibly feel without the other3 but he has
also shewn that the initus motus must proceed from the anima, and not
merely from the anima, but from that part of it which is the animus,
and not merely from the animus, but from that fourth nameless substance
in it 3 the anima and animus then form one connected whole in the
body 3 if therefore any atoms of the anima are moved they will at once
communicate with the animus, and sense will commence and be imparted
to the whole anima, and from the anima to the body which will then
feel. But many atoms of the body he argues may be touched without
any part of the soul being moved, and therefore without there being any
commencement of sensation: see what presently follows, 391-395,
adhaesum: this word occurs three times in Lucr. and seems to be found
