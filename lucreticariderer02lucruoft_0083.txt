he formed them 3 and that these primitive particles being solids are
incomparably harder than any porous bodies eompounded of thern, even
so very hard as never to wear or break to pieces’. Farther on he speaks
of ‘particles of matter of several sizes and figures and several proportions
to space, and perhaps of different densities ancl forees'. His particles
agree in every point with those of Lucr. except in the concluding words.
It appears from a most interesting discussion in Edleston's correspon-
dence of N ewton and Ootes p. 75 foll. that Ootes objected to one of the
corollaries of his principia, unless he altered the last clause just quoted
from his optics. Upon which Newton thanks him for explaining his
objection and adds a fourth corollary, Si omnes omnium corporum parti-
culae solidae sint eiusdem densitatis neque absque poris rarefieri possint,
vacuum datur, thus coming to a complete agreement with Lucr.
551—576: if these first bodies did not set a limit to the division of
things, nothing could come into being-3 for as things are destroyed more
quicklythan they are renewed, infinite time to come could not restore what
infinite time past had gone on breaking up: again with solid first bodies
the existence of soft things can be explained by help of void: with soft
first bodies the existence of hard things cannot be understood. 553
