organic world nor in the inorganic is power produced without the expen-
diture of other power'. nilo: nil is always a monosyll. in Lucr., nilum
and nilo are always dissyll. as is proved by this, that in most cases they
must be, in all cases they may be of this quantity ; and in no case need
be dissyll. and trisyll. respectively. After the usual fashion of mss. A
and B with hardly an exception write nihil, ozi-hilum, nihilo: see Lach-
mann's precise note, who shews that Virgil in reality uses nihil only
twice as a dissyll. 151 continet seems to be used as in Quint. Ι 3 6
Quosdam continet metus, quosdam debilitat 3 Livy XXX 20 5 quae pauca
mayis metu quam fide continebcmtur: Lexicons give othrer instances.
153 Quor. operum: see n. to 15. 156 (157) quod sequimur Bentl.
explains by τὸ ζητούμενον, τὸ ἀπορούμενον, 35 VI 808 ubi amenti venas
aurique secuntur: comp. Cic. ad Att. 111 16 si spes erit, Epirum ,· sin
miuus, Cyzicum aut aliud quid sequemur 3 x 18 2 Formias nunc sequi-
mur 3 XII 27 1 sequor celebritatem; Aen. IV 361 I baliam non sponte sequor.
157 158 (158 155) et—et—explain quod sequimur: these two verses
therefore merely state in other words Nullam rem e nilo yiqni divinitus.
158 (155) quaeque is neut.: comp. 57. opera sine divom is said per-
haps with reference to Accius 159 Nam ‘non facile sine deum opem
humana propria sunt bona.

159—214: if things could arise from nothing, any animal might be
born any where, any fruit grow on any tree. But that every thing 15
produced from 3 definite seed is proved in many ways: flowers corn fruits
come at stated seasons: again 3111111315 and plants require time to grow
up: the products of the earth want rain at stated times, animals food:
men are of a definite size, and never grow to a gigantic bulk: lastly the
fruits of the earth require cultivation, and do not improve spontaneously.
-From the nature of the case this is rather a full statement of what he
means by nothing coming from nothing, than a proof: his theory of fixed
unchangeable seeds of things or atonis he subsequently demonstrates with
great clearness and power: some of his arguments even Newton seems
not to have disdained to borrOW. 159 almost a transl. of what Epic.
himself says in his letter to Herod. Diog. Laert. x 38, quoted by Lamb.

ματός γε οὖθὲν προσδεόμενον. 161 mare: this abl. is common in Ovid,
and is found in Plautus who puns on amare and a mare, and in both the
Varros: see Neue Formenl. 1 p. 233 and Priscian and Charisius quoted
there. Ovid has caeleste bimenstre and more than once rivale, Lucan
natale: comp. 1013 simplice and 11 635 pernice and n. there: 566 3150 the

other particle: VI 1068 Saxa vides primum cet.: this form of expression
is common enough in Cicero and others ; as Ter. Andr. 211 3 Virg. geor.
