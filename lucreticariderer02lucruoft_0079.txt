Epic. in Diog. Laert. X 72, 01· the fuller passage of Sextus l. l. 219
Ἐπίκουρος δὲ...τόν χρόνον σύμπτωμα συμπτωμάτων εἶναι λέγει παρεπόμενον
ἡμέραις τε καὶ νυξὶ καὶ ὥραις καὶ πάθεσι καὶ ἀπαθείαις καὶ κινήσεσι καὶ
μοναῖς. πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα συμπτώματοῖ ἐστι τισὶ συμβεβηκότα. Time
therefore is an accident of accidents: Lucr. treats the question with
reference to the accidents of body and void last mentioned by Sextus,
viz. states of motion and states of rest. Lucr. may well have been
thinking of the strange words of Chrysippus in the first book of his
φυσικοὶ ζητήματα, quoted by Plutarch de comm. not. p. 1084 D, οὐχ ἦ
μὲν νὺξ σῶμά ἐστιν, ἦ δ’ ἑσπέρα καὶ ὁ ὀρθρὸς καὶ τὸ μέσον τῆς νυκτός

σῶμα, καὶ ἦ δεκάτη καὶ πεντεκαιδεκάτη καὶ ἦ τριακάς, καὶ ὁ μὴν σῶμά

the connecting particle, deinde belongs to sequatur, as a connecting
particle is wanted: otherwise Plautus ι]’01113 deinde porro and iude

coyam plainly refer to Chrysippus and the stoics who, as we saw, taught
that accidents were bodily entities, time an immaterial entity: they doubt-
less therefore used the hymonymes esse, esse to prove that as for instance
the rape of Helen was, therefore the rape exists of itself, and the like:

Troy. 469 as usual, to make his argument more vivid, he has taken
a special case intelligible to all, the conquest of Troy. This illustration
he continues : Teucris therefore takes the place of the generic Corporis
of 482, regionibus of loci: notice too the quodcumque erit actum of
a special past event, not ayetur: he singles out Teucris here, because he
had singled out Troiiuqenas yemis in 405: the Greeks in both cases
would have answered his purpose, had 116 30 chosen. 471 116 3661113
