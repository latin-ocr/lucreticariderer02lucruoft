BOOK IV NOTES ΙΙ 239

faces themselves which fill the whole width of the sky'. From nothing
in Lucr. or Epicurus or any of their expositors, ancient or modern, have
I been able to gather what their conception was, if they had one, of the
superficial extent of an image5 whether for instance when you saw a
thing of large extent, you saw it by a succession of single images, or of
many images, advancing in parallel order and preserving their relative
positions.

176—229: the velocity with which these images travel is enormous:
light things made of fine atoms often travel very swiftly, as sunlight; it
is natural then that these lmages should do the same· of which too there
is' a constant succession one following on the other like light or heat from
the sun: again these' lmages pmceed from the vely surface of things and
should therefore travel more swiftly than light: a proof of the prodigious
swiftness of these unages is this: put water in the open air, and at once
all the stars of heaven are reflected in it. As images come from all
things to the sight, so do things producing smell taste sound and the
like 3 so that all the senses are similarly moved. 179 quem quaeque

illa tendunt. The wretchedly scanty fragments from the 2nd book of
Epicurus περὶ φύσεως, publishcd in the vol. Hercul. 11, are yet enough to
indicate that Lucr. followed it as his guide: col. 1 we find περὶ δὲ τῆς
