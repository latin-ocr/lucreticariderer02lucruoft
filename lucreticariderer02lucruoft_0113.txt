951—957 : I have proved the existence of indestructible atonis and
of void or space: are these atoms infinite in number‘l is this space infi-
nite in extent? 955 Seu: for this use of a single seu=vel‚ comp. VI
1003 sive aestum, and Ι 1019 ; and see C. F. W. Mueller ueb. sive p. 21.
95¹7 profundum in Lucr. means unfathomably deep, and hence is almost
synon. with immensus: comp. his use of solidus, plenus, celer, maynus
and the like in n. to iv 63.

958—98'7 : well then the universe is bounded on no side 3 for then it
must have an end or outside 3 in which case there must be something
beyond it, which may be seen to bound it 3 but there can be nothing
outside the universe, which is therefore boundless on all sides. Again
say for the moment space is finite: go now to its verge and fiing a jave-
lin: will it go in the direction you throw it, or will it be stopped by
something? if there is something beyond to stop it, that something is in
the universe 3 if it goes on, it has not started from the end of space:
therefore you will be always in the universe, wherever you fling it.
Lastly whatever you see, is bounded by and into something different3
earth by sea, sea by earth and the like 3 but what is there outside to
bound the universe'l—Lucr. has had great injustice done him here by the
misapprehension of his editors and others who strangely take omne quod
est, omne quod est spatium, ‘rerum summa to be all synonymes: a right
explanation of 968 si iam . . constituatur, and the transposition which I
have made of 984 (998)—987 (1001) will I believe make his argument
quite clear: he is going to shew that space is infinite and matter infinite :
the former he proves 988 (984)-1007, the latter 1008—1051 3 but first
for the sake of completeness he states in our present section that the
universe or omne or τὸ πᾶν 13 infinite. There can of course properly
speaking be no proof of this as Lucr. has wisely seen: it must from the
nature of the case be shewn by a series of identical propositions‚ call
them as you please definitions postulates or axioms: these propositions
however are most clearly put by him, when he is rightly interpreted.
958 quod est is added to Omne, as in 523: so 969 Omne quod est spa-
tium: it equals τὸ ὅν, which Sen. epist. 58 7 apologises for having 3ο to
translate: ‘cogor verbum pro vocabulo ponere 3 sed ita necesse est ponam
quod est’. τὸ πᾶν 13 Epicurus' term : Lucr. calls it also summa omnis,
summa summai totius omnis, summa summarum and sometimes omnia.
mol. req. vi. : take whichever of the roads through the universe you please,
at no point 111 any of them will you reach its bound : comp. 11 260 and
