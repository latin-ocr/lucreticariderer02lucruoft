BOOK VI NOTEs 11 383

840-84'7: the water of wells is colder in summer, because they let
out their seeds of heat through the earth which is then rarefied by heat:
the contrary is the case in winter for the contrary reason. 845
Friqore—concrescil: see n. to 111 20 uix acri concreta pruina.

848—8'78: the fountain by the temple of Hammon is cold. by day,

warni by night, not, as is absurdly said, because the sun below the earth
warms it, but because the earth about it condenses at night and so
squeezes into the water its seeds of heat3 and then by day receives these
back again—Curtius Arrian Pliny Mela and others speak of this pro-
perty of the fountain: Ovid met. XV 309 medio tua, corniyer Hammon,
Unda die qelida est, ortuque obituque calescit. Curtius lv 31 gives the
fullest and most precise account. 854 and 863 corpus aquai: Emped.
285 ὕδατος τέρεν δέμας οἷργυφέοιο. 858 satiare: Cic. Arat. 364 Cum
supera sese satiavit luce, where mSS. have 3002·ch Germanicus 588
Siderea vix tum satiatus luce, the words of Aratus being ὁ δ’ ἐπὴν φάεος
κορέσηται. 864 roriferis cet: Aen. IV 351 quotiens umentibus umbris
Nom operit terras. 868 aqic'ae: see n. to 552. 869 dimovit appears
to have the same force as in Virg. geor. 11 513 Ayricola incurvo
terram dimovit aratro. 875 in lucem: see n. to 712 iu aestatem.
877 quasi, in the sense of ‘as'‚ is very common in Lucr. 878 nodos:
a bold continuation of the metaphor involved in exolvit: Hor. epist. 1 3

vincula rupi& comp. too 531 mora quae fluvios passim refrenat euntis.

879-905: there is also a cold fountain which ignites tow or pine-
wood put over it: it contains many seeds of latent fire, which rise up
and set on fire this tow or wood, as fiame will light a freshly extin—
guished wick, before actual contact.—Pliny 11 228 and Mela 11 43 tell
this fact of a fountain at Dodona, to which Lucr. probably refers.

890 endo: see n. to 1 82 Indum-edi: Ennius in ann. has Indu mari

Phoenicia: this fountain was very famous 3 see Strabo p. 754 for the
use the inhabitants made of itg it is said to be used in the present day.

p. 72 ‘opposite to the fountain [Arethusa] at the distance of about
200 yards a large submarine stream of fresh water rises in the sea, of
which the Arethusa itself is apparently a branch’ 3 Sir E. Tennent
describes similar springs in Ceylon. 894 intervomit appears not to
be found elsewhere. 896 sem. quae: see n. to 1 15. 900 rnoc. ad

Circe the cedrus served for fire and candle. 901 the language of
Pliny 1. l. is very similar, in Dodone I ovis fons. . ,si eti-t iactae admoveantur
(i.e. faces) accendit. ubi admoveas: see n. to 11 41 foll. 904 imbuat:
