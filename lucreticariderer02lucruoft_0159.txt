Phrygian Ida: the whole worship was purely Phrygian : Eurip. Bacch.

though, as we can see 111 this very passage, the Phrygian and Cretan
legends got mixed together. 613 creariznasci: therefore coepisse
may be used instead of coeptas esse. 614 ηαφῃεη...11[αινί316. Cybeles,
though Creech sneers at poor Fayus of the Delphin for so taking it.

it appears from old paintings that the tympanum was struck with the
open hand: Catul. 64 261 Plaugsehant alii proceris tympana palmis,

629 Curetas...Pltry9ios‚ called after 633 the Dictaeos Curetas: most
Greek authorities confine the Curetes to Crete, and call the Phrygian

ται and Κορύβαντες both in Crete, and so Ovid l. 1. 210 unites the two,
