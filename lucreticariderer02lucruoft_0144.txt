those of many then living, he might have discovered the laws of univer-
sal gravity, and not only the laws, but, what was the despair of N ewton,
its mechanical cause. Had he supposed the earth to be spherical and
made his atoms move in directions perpendicular to the surface of a
sphere, that is towards its centre, he might not only have proved the law
of the inverse square of the distance, but have demonstrated the cause of
that law. But the truth is Epicurus might probably have left his worlds
to shift for themselves and let eterna] time past take the place of a first
cause, if he had not wanted this theory mainly as we have said to explain
the great mystery of freewill: he wished to mark this as one of the
cardinal points of difference between himself and Democritus whom
Cicero praises for choosing to accept fate and necessity rather than have
recourse to such a doctrine as this of Epicurus. It is for this reason
that Lucr. dwells at such length and with such emphasis on this part of
the question 3 out of respect for Democritus as well as opposition to the
stoics. See N. British Review l. 1. p. 223 ‘it is a principle of mechanics
that a force acting at right angles to the direction in which a body is
moving does no work, although it may continually and continuously
alter the direction in which the body moves...It is clear to us that Epi-
curus, when he devised his doctrine of a little swerving from the straight
path of an atom‚ had an imperfect perception of this mechanica] doctrine
...We can see that their conception was not stupid, it was simply false,
as all physica] explanations of the origin of energy and matter must be’.

294—307 ε 11116 matter of the whole universe never was either more
or less condensed than it is now: the motions which first-beginnings now
have, they always have had and will have: what they have produced,
they will again produce: the sum of things no force can change3 for no
new matter can escape out of the universe nor come into it and change
the order of nature. 294 foll. as his atoms are eternal, it is an axiom
that none can come into being or go out of being: the sum of matter
therefore must ever be the same. 296 adauqescit: in the use of this
word Cic. prognost. frag. 3 has preceded him. 297 in motu...in
eodem: see n. to 1 999. 300 quae consuerint i.e. ea quae, such things
as: the subj. is quite in place, though Lamb. objects to it. 301 Con·
dicione : this spelling is now incontrovertibly fixed by reason and autho-
rity3 cond. is related to condicere, as dicio to dicere ε the latter point is
proved by Cicero himself de leg. agrar. 11 39, where he puts together
dicioni iudicio, and then clearly implies that dicere is to dicio what iudi-
care is to iudicium. 305 quicquam est extra: comp. v 361 summarum
summa est aeterna neque eastra Qui locus est quo dissiliant neque corpora
sunt quae Possint incidere, and Ι 963 eaetra summam quoniam nil esse
fatendum. Epicurus in Diog. Laer. X 39 says more generally τὸ πᾶν ἀεὶ
τοιοῦτον ἦν οἷον νῦν ἐστὶ καὶ ἀεὶ τοιοῦτον ἔσται · οὐθὲν γάρ ἐστιν εἷς ὃ μετα-
βάλλει, παροὶ γσῘρ τὸ πᾶν οὐθέν ἐστιν ὃ ἂν εἰσελθὸν εἰς αὐτὸ τὴν μεταβολὴν
