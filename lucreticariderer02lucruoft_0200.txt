451 : sense is a mere eventum, which comes to both body and soul by
their reciproca] action one upon the other3 and when this ceases, all
sense ceases for both alike. Lach. I now see to be mistaken in marking
off this and the next two paragraphs, as not connected with what pre-
cedes and follows : the above vss. are a manifest continuation and com-
pletion of the preceding arguinent3 are in fact a summary of Epic. 1. 1.
64 διό ἀπαλλαγείσης τῆς ψυχῆς οὐκ ἔχει τὴν αἴσθησιν (τὸ σῶμα)· οὗ γσῖρ αὐτὰ
ἐν ἑαυτῷ ταύτην ἐκέκτητο τήν δύναμιν, ἀλλ’ ἑτέρῳ ἅμα συγγεγενημένῳ αὑτῷ
παρεσκεύαζεν, ὃ διὰ τῆς συντελεσθείσης περὶ αὐτὸ δυνάμεως κατοί τὴν κίνησιν
σύμπτωμα αἰσθητικὸν εὐθὺς ἀποτελοῦν ἑαυτῷ, ἀπεδίδου κατὰ τήν ὁμούρησιν
καὶ συμπάθειαν καὶ ἐκείνῳ, καθάπερ ein-ov: it gets for itself and imparts in
turn sense to the soul. At the same time this and succeeding paragraphs
are clearly in an unfinished state, their connexion being often so loose
that they might be intel-changed in a variety of ways without loss to the
general argument. But surely it was the poet himself who left them in
this inchoate condition. 357 in aevozin vita 5 so ea: ineunte aevo five
or six timeszex ineunte vita : we have also in Lucr. aevi florem 3 Deyitur
hoc aevi3 partem maiorem conteris aevi; tolerarit aevom ; eaeiyat aevom3
colere aevom 3 consumit aevom 3 deyebant aevom: the poetical aevom having
the various senses of vita and aeta-53 and in aevo being used here as in
aetate by Plautus. 358 quam emp. ante: see n. to 973 quam nascimur
ante: my correction of this v. which I now believe to be the poet's, is I
think specious: quam was put in the margin, having become illegible
and passed into um in the V.‚ and the aevo came from aevo at the end of
the prec. v. The body loses sense, you say: yes, certainly, it loses sense,
a mere accident 3 just as duriny lffe it 10868 many other things, strength,
beauty‚ etc. before the anima is expelled; for the sense shews that anima
is nomin. of conpellitur, i. e. anima nondum dimissa: a fortiore, dimissa.
359—369 ; the assertion that the eyes cannot see, but that the mind
sees through them, as through a door, is contradicted by their sense: nay
bright objects often hinder the eyes from seeing them3 but this could
not happen to doors 3 nay if eyes act as doors, we ought to see better by
entirely taking away these doors. 359 foll. Sextus adv. math. VII
350 says οἱ δὲ αὐτὴν (τὴν διάνοιαν) εἶναι τὰς αἰσθήσεις, καθάπερ διά τινων
ὀπῶν τῶν αἰσθητηρίων προκύπτουσαν, ἧς στάσεως ἦρξε Στράτων τε 0‘ φυσικὸς
καὶ Αἷνησίδημος : Lassalle Herakl. 1 p. 316 well compares with this what
Sextus 1.1. 130 says of Heraclitus, ἐν δὲ ἐγρηγορόσι πάλιν διὰ τῶν αἰσθητι-
κῶν πόρων ὥσπερ διά τινων θυρίδων προκύψας (ὁ ἐν ’ἡμῖν νοῦς) καὶ τῷ περιέ-
