had in mind: 195 Cicero writes validis viribus austrum without cum.
VI 73 placida cum pace quietos, 279 ipse sua cum Mobilitate calescit are
like in principle 3 and vl 1233 maesto cum corde iacebant: Cicero in his
Aratea quite revels in this use of cum: in the few hundred lines which
remain I have counted 23 instances more or less similar to those quoted.
288 dat straqem : see n. to Iv 41. sub undis. ..volvit is found in Aen. 1
100. 289 quicquid, with c, = quicque τ 113 15 an archaism not uncom-
mon in Lucr. who has unum, primum, summum quicquid: it is found in
Plautus, and is not unknown to Cicero: 500 Madvig de fin. V 24: nor to
Livy, as XXXVIII 17 13 in sua quicquid sede. For the constr. see note to
15: it=qua aliquid fluctibus obstat, id ruit amnis: comp. n. to 966
quem quisque locum possedit. With qua quicquid comp. v 733 Quafieri
quicquid posset ratione 3 111 787 and v 131 ubi quicquid ε comp. too Aen.
VII 400 io matres, audite, ubi quaeque, Latinae: Plaut. Bacch. 252 I
would read Istius bominis ubi fit quaeque (quaque mss, quomque Lamb.

44 5 3 51 1 ubi quemque periculum ceperat 3 60 1 ubi quisque Zeyatus aut
tribunus curabat3 [Cat. 56 2 and 3 z Plaut. Amph. 1064 ubi quemque
bominem aspeoeero...optruncabo in aedibu33 1079 Ubi quisque institerat,
concidit strepitu3 asin. 244 exobsecrabo ut quemque amicum videro]

291 procumbit is used of the wind in same sense VI 558. 293 Virg.
Aen. VII 567 has torto vertice torrens, and Lucr. is purposely using
ternis common to rivers and winds. vertice torto and rotanti turbine
seem to be the same thing 3 and the tautology is like that in 275. 296
moribus: Virg. geor. Ι 51 Ventos et varium caeli praediscere morem 3
which Pliny XVIII 206 thus expresses quippe Verqilio iubente praedisci
ventos ante omnia ac siderum mores. 297 aperto the opposite to
caecus,

300 tuimur: also tuantur tuere are found in Lucr. and contuimur:
the older writers frequently form this verb and its compound acc. to this
conjug: comp. cimus above. 301 Usur. oc.: IV 975 sensibus usur-
pare. Plautus too has neque oculis neque pedibus neque oculis usurpavi :
see Fore. 306 eaedem, eadem and eodem are found as dissyll. in Luem
idem (plur.) and isdem are always diss.; but eadem eandem eundem,
where the vowel is short by nature, are always trisyll. : eosdem easdem
do not occur in Lucr. : they might be either diss. or trisyll. dispansae:
dispessus is also used by Lucr. serescunt : this passage is quoted by
Nonius 175 3 and it seems to be the only known use of the word : serenus
is clearly connected with it and Nonius adds ‘inde Vergilius docte geor.
Ι [461] uncle serenas Ventus aqat nubes', having just explained serescit by

siccatur. 30¹7 umor umidus umecto and umerus are rightly read in
AB. 311—314 comp. Ov. ars 1 473 Ferreus adsiduo consumitur
anulus usu. Interit adsidua vomer aduncus humo. 311 solis annis,

because the annus was made by the revolution of the sun : Varro de ling.
