rebus· relictis, well illustrated by Lamb. from Plautus and Terence,
means ceteris rebus relictis: Caesar and Livy have omuibus rebus relictis,
omnibus omissis rebus, omissis rebus. 1072 Felz'ae qui potuit rerum
coynoscere causas5 and Epic. in Diog. x 143 οὐκ ἦν τὸ φοβούμενον
λύειν ὑπὲρ τῶν κυριωτάτων μὴ κατειδότα τίς ἡ τοῦ σύμπαντος φύσις
κ.τ.λ. 1070—10'75: men know not the cause of their disease: it is
that from want of employment they are possessed with ennui3 and
fron] want of right employment they are disquieted with fear of death
and suffering after death. If wisc, they would study the true system of
things, which would teach them the real nature of the eternity to come,
and prove to them that they have nothing to fear. Once more his
favourite moral.

1076—1094: again why such a craving for life mid troubles and
dangers'l death cannot be shunned: no nor does length of life create any
new pleasure; while the future may bring evil as well as good fortune 3
and live as long as we may, the eternity of death will ever be the same.
1076 in dub. periclis, as 55.1078 it is possible that the equidem of
mss. comes from Lucr. as we cannot assume that he followed the mistaken
theory, adopted by Cicero and many others, that equidem is eqo quidem.

aves quod abest, praesentia temnis 1084 hiantis, keeping up the me-
taphor of sitis. 1085 has a proverbial smack, as Virg. geor. 1 461 quid

dies cito conditum paneg. ΒΟ eum tibi dies omnis summa cum utilitate
nostra, summa cum tua laude condatur: Virg. ecl. IX 52 has louqos...
cantando condere soles, where Conington says condere to bury, for to see
go down, and he and Heyne compare Callim. epigr. 11 3 Ἠέλιον λέσχῃ
κατεδύσαμεν; but such 3 use is better suited to sol or dies, than saecla 3,
and it seems likely that Lucr. was thinking rather of the technical
condere lustrum, though what the exact force of that expression is οι·
how far it differs from facere lustrum, I cannot tell: yet Livy 1 44 2
says idque condilum lustrum appellatum, quia is censendo finis jactus
