594 foll. repeated from 75 foll. Hear again what Newton l. l. p. 260
says to illustrate this and the preceding section 557—564, ‘while the
particles continue entire, they may compose bodies of one and the same
nature and texture in all ages 3 but should they wear away or break in
pieces, the nature of things depending on them would be changed.
lVater and earth composed of old worn particles and fragments of
particles would not be of the same nature and texture now with water
and earth composed of entire particles in the beginning. And therefore
that nature may be lasting, the changes of corporeal things are to be
placed only in the various separations and new associations and motions
of these permanent particles‚ compound bodies being apt to break not
in the midst of solid particles‚ but where those particles are laid together
and only touch in a few points⁷.

599—634: these first-beginnings have parts, but their parts are so
small as not to admit of existence separate from the atom: the atom
therefore has not been formed from a union of these parts, but they have
existed in it unchangeably from eternity: such parts then are but one
more proof that the first-beginnings arc of everlasting singleness : again
without such ultimate least things, the smallest and largest thing will
alike consist of infinite parts, and thus will be equal: again if nature
went in division beyond the atom, such least things as these parts of the
