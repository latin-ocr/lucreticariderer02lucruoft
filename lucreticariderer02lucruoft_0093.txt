it is of no use to condense or rarefy fire, if it always remains fire ι nay
they deny void without which even this condensing and rarefying is im-
possible. But if they say the fire is extinguished in the process, they
make things come from nothing. The truth is there are certain first
bodies which are not like fire or any thing in being, but which produce
fire and all other things alike by their varied shapes motions arrange-
ments collisions. 645 foll. Heracl. frag. 41 Schl. πυρὸς οἷνταμείβεται

Themistius ap. Schleierm. p. 95 says in exact conformity with Lucr.
Ἡράκλειτος τὸ πῦρ οἴεται μόνον στοιχεῖον καὶ ἐκ τούτου ’γεγονέναι τὰ πᾶνῑ
Brandis however Gesch. d. Entwick. d. Gr. Phil. p. 67 says that this
fire or Warm exhalation of Heraclitus is that for which all things are ex-
changed, as wares for gold 3 but it changes itself as little into the things,
as gold changes into these wares, and that later interpreters misappre-
hended him. Grote too, Plato 1 p. 28, says ‘when we put together all
that remains from him, it appears that his main doctrine was not physi-
cal, but metaphysical or ontological : that the want of adequate general
terms induced him to clothe itin a multitude of symbolical illustrations,
among which fire was only one, though the most prominent and most
significant.’ However that be, Lucr. is here speaking of his followers,
espec. the stoics, as remarked above. 648 rarefieri and rarefacere
always in Lucr. have ἐς 50 vacefit putrefactus eaqyerqijfaetus, all more than
once: confervffacit, patefecit and paiz-fiet once, but oftener patef3 so

tepeffaetus, timefactus, conlabffctctus, conlabfffiunt 2 facit are is uncertain:
the e was originally long, the Latins having had a strong tendency to
shorten final syllables. Ovid and Catullus, so far as they use such
words, have much the same varieties of quantity as Lucr. ε Ritschl opusc.

short, as caleffacio, ἒ when that Syll. is long, as pfftfffacit. 649 super

is right in making the constr. of this sentence to be ‘si partes ignis ean-
dem naturam, quam totus ignis habet, super haberent': it is another
instance of that involution of words illustrated at 111 843 ε but I do not
take super haberent as he does 3 but simply as=‘ etiam haberent’: comp.

tus for opinatio, formatura for conformatio, are confined to him, or to
him and his constant imitator Arnobius: satias for satietas is more gene-
