Ovid and Persius. 87¹7 eicit: 1v 1272 Eicit euim 3 Virg. ecl. 111 96
reice capellas 3 [Hor. sat. 1 6 139 Deicere de saoco3] Stat. Theb. 1v 574
reicitqu65 Sen. Phoen. 426 proiciet: Seneca often has adice, obici,
abicit or subicit. 878 esse...super i.e. superesse. 880 in morte, after
death: Seu. epist. 30 5 and 8 uses in ipsa morte for the moment of
dying, but 9 in morte means ‘after death' as in Lucr. 881 miseret
personal: Ennius 1138 miserete and misererent; Virgil uses miseresce.
illim, the same as illinc: Cicero uses both illim and istim: on these
and cognate forms see Ritschl opusc. 11 p. 452-459. dividit illim
1.3. ab illo se: it seems simpler not 10 join it with removet and so
make a proiecto corpore an epexegesis of it, as Lach. does 3 though that
would perhaps resemble Virg. ecl. 1 54 Hiuc...vicino ab limite.

883 contaminat has here the neutral sense that the subst. coutayia basin
345 corporis atque animai Mutua comaque, and 740 cousensus contayia.
885 alium se: Quintil. ΧΠ 11 2 cavendum est...ue se quaerat priorem.
888 Nam 031. with reference to lacerari urive, because it was vulgarly
thought that to be mangled by beasts was 3 niisfortune‚ to be burnt on a

mus, ubi servis irascimur: comp. also Sen. epist. 92 34. 889 Tractari5
an unusual meaning: in Ennius and others it has the sense of to drag:

denote one mode of burial, that of embalming and laying 111 3 sarcopha-
gus: though in the time of Lucr. burning on a pile and gathering the
ashes in an urn was the common method, the other was also praetised;
the numerous sarcophagi of 311 3338 313 sufficient proof of this. 891
iu melle: it appears from many passages that honey was a prinoipal
means of preserving a dead body: see Xenophon Varro J osephus in
Lamb. and Hav. [Alexander's body was so preserved: Stat. silv. 111 2

prob. denotes the bottom of the sarcophagus on which the embalmed
body was laid out: 871 corpore posto: but bodies were sometimes stretched
03 1113 11313 rock out of which the tomb was hewn, as proved by many
ancient tombs that have been opened: or it may refer to 3 stone bed,
like the lecti mortuarii of the Etruscans: see corp. inser. I 1313 for a
curious inscription found in a sepulchral chamber at Falerii, in which
they are assigned to various people, these lecti being hewn 0111 of the
rocky walls. [Comp. Mart. VIII 44 13 Supraque pluteum te iacente vel
