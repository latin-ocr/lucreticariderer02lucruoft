sine hominum labore et manzo ,- 14 sine hominum manu atque opera.

mel. red. fet: comp. Cic. de orat. 11 131 quo meliores setus possit et
mundiores edere (aqer): reddere is regularly used in this sense. fetus
with one exception always in Lucr. means the produce of the earth or
trees. 210 videlicet has here the construction of videre licet : so 11 469
Scilicet esse ylobosa: the same constr. is found in Plautus, Terence, Sallust,
once in Cicero, ad Att. V 11 7, and in the antiquarians Fronto and
Gellius: on the other hand Lucr. 11 809 Scire licet. . putandum est, uses
scire licet for scilicet. 211 212 repeated with slight change V 210
211. cimus he uses only in these two places, ciere being the com. form:
ΙΙΙ 303 percit, VI 410 concil, 11 327 emitur: he also has emaus. 213
214 if there were no first-beginnings, things might be much worse or
much better quite independently of our control.

215—264 ε nothing can be reduced to nothing: things dissolve into
their first-beginnings: if this were not so, a thing might pass away in a
moment without any force: again how could all things, animate and
inanimate, be replenished‘Z if nothing were imperishable, infinite time
past must have reduced all things to nothing: a mere touch would
destroy all things alike: rains pass away3 but the earth which receives
them sends forth her produce, and from it all animals are nourished:
nothing therefore is utterly destroyed. 216 Epic. after what is quoted
ab 159, continues καὶ εἰ ἐφθείρετο δὲ τὸ ἀφανιζόμενον εἷς τὸ μὴ ὅν, πάντ’
ἂν ἀπολώλει τσῖ πράγματα, οὔκ ὅντων τῶν εἷς ἃ διελύετο. dissoluat:

doubtful point. interemat and 226 peremit ι A and B, as all good mss.
of all good authors, invariably thus spell these words 3 as also ozeyleyo and
intelleqo. 21¹7 Nam, 219 euim: Lucr. does not at all avoid thus
using nam, enim5 nam, nam, enim, enim, and the like in consecutive
sentences, as the Greeks use γάρε occasionally we find them in three
successive clauses: 11 749 enim, 751 enim, 753 Nam; 111 754 enim,
756 enim, 757 enim 3 v 7 Nam, 13 enim, 14 Namque: thus Cicero ad
Att. 11 3 2 has ‘riam—etenim—enim—nam in 4 consecutive short sen-
tences 3 and xv1 6 2 enim—enim-enim in 3. 221 Quod nunc: see

latter: he also employs both constructions with consisto. [He has
