700—729: but all elements cannot unite in all ways: else monsters 01
all kinds would arise: every creature has its fixed seeds, its fixed mother ;
and thus is kept within its limits3 and 01 the elements it takes as 10οά
501110 only remain, others are rejected as unsuitable: and so it is with
inanimate as well as animate things 3 they have each elements different
or differently combined 3 and the modes of action 01 these elements differ,
50 that not only living bodies, but all nature, earth sea and heaven, are
kept distinct. 700 1011. this question is more fully discussed v 837—

Terence has necessus fuit, sit necessus: Plautus necessumst, necessust,
necesse est, all three forms found in Lucr. But necessust in Plautus must

'7 25—-729 as the atoms differ in shape‚ then the void spaces between them,
when they are in union, must differ 3 and therefore the passages, the
manner in which they are linked together, the weights collisions and the
like must all differ: thus not only does each living thing preserve its
individuality‚ but inanimate things as well3 and indeed the great divi-
sions 01 the whole world, earth sea and heaven, are kept from inter-
mingling: heaven earth sea have all many common elements‚ but as a
rule the heavier and those which unite more closely will seek the heavier
earth, the lighter the lighter ether or air and the like. ‘726 Intervalla

730—756: atoms have no colour whatever: the mind has to conceive
them as without colour3 for any colom· may change into any other, but
the first bodies are unchangeable, or things would pass into nothing.—

qualities, colour and the like: the impert 01 this section is briefly given
