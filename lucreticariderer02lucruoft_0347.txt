clam ceteris esse velim: see n. to 11 568 palam est: one might take the
last words of Cicero quoted below for a conscious paraphrase of this
verse of Lucr. Here again we may notice, as was observed at 1020,
that Lucr. softens and tones down what Epicurus himself expresses in
all its naked harshness, Diog. Χ 151 ἦ α’δικία ού καθ’ ἑαυτήν κακόν, ἀλλ’ ἐν
τῷ κατὰ τὴν ὑποψίαν φόβῳ εἷ μή λη’σει τοὺς ὑπὲρ τῶν τοιούτων ἐφεστηκότας

παρόντος λανθάνῃ· μέχρι γὰρ καταστροφῆς ἄδηλον εἶ καὶ λήσειῐ Sen. epist.

1161--11932 men believed in and worshipped gods, because they
saw with their waking minds and still more in sleep shapes of preter-
human size and beauty and strength: as these shapes were ever present
and as their might appeared.so great, they deemed theth to be immortal ;
and to be blessed, because they could do such deeds and had no fear of
death: they saw too the seasons change, and all the wonders of the
heaven 3 they therefore placed their gods in heaven and believed all
things to be governed by their providence. 1163 sacra, 1164 sciara:

been said already of the gods of Epicurus, 146 foll. and 11 646 foll„ and
many passages quoted: Sextus adv. math. lx 25 exactly agrees with
Lucu, Ἐπίκουρος δὲ ἐκ τῶν κατὰ τοὺς ὕπνους φαντασιῶν οἴεται τοὺς ἀνθρώ-
πους ἔννοιαν ε’σπακέναι θεοῦ. μεγάλων γάρ εἰδώλων, φησί, καὶ ἅνθρωπο-

quae enim alia forma occurrit umquam aut viyilanti cuiquam aut
dormienti? all this part of Cicero will illustrate Lucr. who means to
say that all these sensible impressions of the form size and beauty of
the gods are true, even that of their immortality: it is only the mental
inferences added to these impressions which are false, that of their power
and providence. 1177 Et tamen: comp. 1125 and n. to Ι 1050 ; and
