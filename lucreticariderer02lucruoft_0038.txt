30 BOOK I NOTES II

41—43: it seems to me that Lucr. was writing these lines towards
the close of 695 or four years before his death, when Caesar was consul
and had formed his coalition with Pompey. Memmius was then praetor
designatus, in fierce opposition to Caesar and at that time on the side of
the senate with Cicero and doubtless Lucretius, There was almost a
reign of terror: see Livy epit. 103 Leyes ayrariae a Gaesao-e consule cum
maqna contentione, inrito senatu et altero consule M. Bibulo, latae sunt.

scarcely have been later than 696, as in the spring of 697 Memmius
went as propraetor to Bithynia, with Catullus in his train: see Schwab.
Catull. 1 p. 158 foll. He certainly did not return to Rome before 698,
and the year following Lucr. died.

Gaius Memmius son of Lucius, of the Galerian tribe, had, like the
rest of his family, no cognomen 3 although he has very generally received
one from the editors of Cicero having chosen to alter the correct reading
of mss. ’111 Cic. ep. ad fam. XIII 19 2 O. Alaenius Gemellus to C. Memmius
Gem.: see Mommsen Roem. Muenzw. p. 597. He would appear to have
been a hard selfish unprincipled man, to judge from history and the
character given him by Catullus in his lOth and 28th poems, which
form a curious comment on the ‘worth and sweet friendship' which
Lucr. found in him, deceived‚ as men of his temperament so often are,
by the specious qualities of a worldly man. But he was already dead
when Memmius so flagrantly disgraced himself inrthe matter of the
consulship, and went into exile, abandoned by Caesar to whose party he
had impudently gone over. His country found that ‘the general weal'
could easily enough dispense with his services. His contempt for Latin
letters which Cicero mentions would also seem to fit him but little for
patron to so genuine a Latin poet. Did Lucr. address Memmius as a
believer in Epicurus? or did he rather seek to convert him to that creed¹3
In either case his teaching was sadly thrown away: he called on Mem-
mius to look on Epicurus as a god: it appears from a curious letter, ad
fam. XIII l, written from Athens by Cicero to Memmius who had just
gone to Mytilene, that the latter had obtained from the Areopagus a
piece of ground on which stood some ruins of Epicurus' house, and that
he wished to pull these down in order to build for himself. Though he
had now abandoned the design of building, he churlishly refused to give
up the property to Patro, at that time head of the school. Patro and
his sect looked on these ruins as a holy place 3 and Cicero out of love for
him and his predecessor Phaedrus and above all Atticus, begs Memmius,
as the ground is now of no use to him, to let them have it. All
