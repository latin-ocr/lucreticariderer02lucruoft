though in the next passage he leaves it an open question, as one beyond
the reach of our experience and certain knowledge: 510 caeli si vortitur

rhythm adapted to sense.

509—533: the stars may move from various causes: if the whole
heaven revolves, then must we say that, while an air presses on each
pole and keeps it in its place, the heaven revolves with its stars by a
third air which either blows on it above in the direction in which it
and its stars are going, or beneath in an opposite direction 3 so that
the whole sphere is thus kept in motion like a waterwheel: if the
heaven does not move, then may the stars move because they have in
them fires of ether trying to escape and thus driving them on; 01· an
air blowing from some quarter may impe] them 3 or they may move of
themselves whither their food invites them: it cannot be told for certain
how this goes on in our world 3 but in the countless existing worlds
>every one of these causes is in operation 3 and one must act in this our
world 3 but it is rash to assert that any one must be the sole cause.—
This passage too as Lach. has proved stands in no proper connexion
with what precedes and follows: 534 should at once follow 5083 and at
774 he makes no allusion whatever to this paragraph: clearly then it is
an after addition of the poet’s who had observed that he had entirely
omitted this question of the stars, though he had so fully discussed sun
and moon: it was left then by him unconnected with the rest, and placed
here by his first editor.—The passage generally interrupts the fine flow
and connexion of what precedes and follows3 and 510 caeli si vortitur
orbis, without one word of explanation, is strangely harsh after 505-508
Ipse suos iynis certo fert impete labens cet. It may be true, as Ussing
and others have argued, that the passage would be more in place between
563 and 564 3 it may be that the poet would have finally put it there in
some shape or other 3 but as it now stands, it will adapt itself to no con-
text. 510 Principio: see n. to 505, and comp. 14:36 mundi maynum

heaven must revolve on its axis 3 this axis therefore must be supported
in its position: this is done by an air pressing outside on each pole, and
keeping each fixed in its place3 but then to put the sphere in motion
another force is wanted3 this must be a third air 3 and it may act in two
ways, it may blow at right angles to the poles either above the sphere in
the direction in which the sphere has to move with its stars, 01· 11 may
