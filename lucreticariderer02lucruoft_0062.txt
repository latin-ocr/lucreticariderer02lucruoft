had in view: see notes to parallel passage 11 991 foll. and v 318 foll.
From the Vedas to the pervigilium Veneris poets and philosophers love to
celebrate this union of ether and earth, ether as the father descending in
showers into the lap of mother earth. The notion naturally had birth in
warm climates, such as India, where the excessive heat at stated periods
seemed to bring the ether down in abundant rains which at once quick-
ened all things: hence the Agni of the Rig-Veda cooperating with the
mighty parents heaven and earth to shed abundant showers. This
notion too has induced Lucr. here and elsewhere, where he speaks of
aetheriae nubes and the like, to forget or suppress for a moment his calm
cloudless unsullied ether, and confound it with this upper generator
of heat and rain: the semper innubilus aether of 111 seems in vl omnis iu
imbrem vertier: other poets follow Lucr. ancl Virgil: Ov. met. 1 269

252 nitidae fruyes occurs five times: it seems to imply orops well-
kept and so fiourishing and good-looking: Cic. Ver. 111 47 says Quos eqo
campos antea collesque nitidissimos viridissimosque vidissem, hos ita vas-
tatos ‘nuuc ac desertos viclebam3 Virg. geor. 1 153 interque nitentia
culta. frugres in Lucr. either signifies grain-crops alone or includes
leguminous products in contradistinction to fruits of trees etc. 253
Wakefield well observes that Virg. ecl. x 54 Arboribus: crescent illae,
crescetis amores, imitates the language and rhythm of this verse, while
the sense is quite different. Compare also with 11 2, geor. 1 158 maynum

458 with geor. 111 478 coorta est Tempestas: in each case the words
are the same, the meaning is altogether dissimilar: comp. also Aen.
ΧΠ 906 vacuum per imme said of the air 3 though Lucr. once, 11 116,
uses per inane himself in the same way. Such instances show
how strongly this poem must have impressed itself on Virgil's
mind. 256 canerezcantu resonare. F orc. and his followers cite but
one instance at all similar, from the Aetna 297: comp. however Virg.
