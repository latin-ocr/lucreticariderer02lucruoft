up reeling and gradually comes to his senses: when the mind thenis
thus tempest-tost in bodily disease, how could it battle for ever with
storms in the open air? again the mind may be healed like the body 3 it
is therefore morta] 3 for that which is immortal allows not of any chang-
ing or shifting of parts: the healing therefore of the mind by medicine
and its suffering from disease both alike prove it to be mortal. 459

found in no other writer of authority. 467 voces 1.8. conclamantium:
the custom would in this case be very appropriate in order to decide
whether it were a lethargy or death3 the friends were still ad vitam
revocantes: iam conclamatum est could not yet be said 3 [comp. Prop. V
