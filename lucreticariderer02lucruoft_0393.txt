BOOK VI NOTES 11 385

936-958: let me repeat that all things in being are of rare and

porous bodies, so that partioles can and do pass through them in all
directions : this is proved by the whole of nature. 936 rep. Comm.:

In saxis ac speluncis permanat aquarum Liquiclus umor et uberibus flent
omnia quttis: Wak. compares Lucan lv 301 Antra nec esez'quo stillant
sudantia rore. 944 sslanat cet: Enn. ann. 399 Tum timido manat ex
omni corpore sudor, Aen. 111 175 Tum qeliclus toto manabat corpore
sudor. 950 cum poc. eet.: 1 495 retinentes poeula rite3 111 912 tenent-
que Pocula saepe homines. 951 dissaepta z the subst. hardly occurs
elsewhere, at least in this sense, though the verb is not uncommon.
952 vapos : Nonius p. 487 ⁶ vapor et vapos et timor et timos et labor et
labos ita sunt ut color et colos Lueretius lib. v1 Pervolitant‚ permanat
odos friqusque vaposque' : Augustus in his res gestae still keeps Itonos ;
Livy xxvm 26 14 has colos: see too Neue 1 p. 167 foll. 954 Galli
lorica: Lach. cites Varro de ling. Lat. v 116 lorica, quoel e loris de corio
crudo faciebant. postea subciclit Galli e ferro sub iel vocabulum, eae canulis,

tequnzen: this correction of Lach. seems to me certain3 Lucr. had
doubtless seen or heard how in sieges fire in various shapes had taken
effect on such steel cuirasses. coercet: in lv 647, 657 and Livy 11 58

defines the object. 955 956 ; by the simple transposition of these
vss. I flatter myself I have made this passage clear: et oum tempestas
in terra caeloque coorta est, cumque simul cum ea morbida vis extrin-
secus insinuatur, tum haec tempestas 613 11666 vis, terra coortae in caelum
remotae, 66610 coortae in terram remotae, iura facessunt. My reading
is illustrated and confirmed by 1098 Atque ea vis omnis morborum pesti-
litasque Aut extrinsecus ut nubes nebulaeque superne Per caelum veniunt
aut cet: in these tempestates are the nubes nebulaeque which bring the
morbida vis, comp. too 1119-1124, and 1141 foll. 956 as said in
notes 1, though the mss. are in favour of iure, I have returned to iura,
admonished that facesso seems to have the sense of ‘to be off ² only as an
imperative, or quasi imperative: Plautus' play on the two meaniugs,
rudens 1061, well illustrates this: eqo opinor rem facesso.—si quidem
Sis pudicus, ltine facesse: I find, it is true, facesse, facessit, facessunt,
facesset, one or other, at least a dozen times with this sense in the meta-
morph. of Apuleius 3 but he, 611 ape of the older writers, probably
generalised from the instances of the imperative he found in them.

959-9'782 again partieles emitted from bodies aot very differently
on different things: fire hardens one thing, melts another 3 and so does
water 3 what is pleasant to one creature is hateful to another. 962
facit are: lv 28 ordia prima: Varro de re rust. 1 41 2 has facit putre;
he also uses consue quoque faciunt, exccmde mefecerunt, perferve ita fil 3
