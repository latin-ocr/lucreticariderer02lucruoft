Boon v NOTEs 11 337

Catull. 25 12 Et insolenter aestues velut minuta maqno Deprensa ‘tzaris
in mari, or Cic. Verr. 11 74 aestuabat dubitatione, versabat se in utram-
que partem non solum mente, verum etiam corpore: the- sense of ‘ grows
hot’ seems not so suitable here, as that is an after result.

1105—1135: every (lay men of genius invented improved methods
of life : cities were built, lands and cattle allotted at first according to
n1erit3 but soon the discovery of gold gave all power to the wealthy:
men would not learn how little was needed for happiness 3 they there-
fore sacrificed everything for power and eminence, often when they
had reached the summit, only to be again dashed down: let men thus
struggle on along the path of ambition, since they have no true enjoy-
ment, being really the slaves of their own dependents. 1107 corde:
cor habere is a common phrase 3 see Forc. 1111 facie=1116
pulchro corpore, and means personal appearance, εἶδος, generally. [1112
comp. Enn. ann. 481 viresque valentes] 1118 foll. as Epicurus
himself so often inculcates: Diog. x 144 0‘ τῆς φύσεως πλοῦτος καὶ
ὥρισται καὶ εὐπόριστός ἐστιν, ὅ δὲ τῶν κενῶν δοξῶν εἷς ἄπειρον ἐκπίπτειτ
130 τὸ μὲν φυσικόν πᾶν εὐπόριστόν ἐστι, τὸ δὲ κενὸν δυσπόριστονε With
whom the epicurean agrees in Cic. de fin. 1 46 natura dim'tias quibus
contenta sit et parabilis et terminatas habet cet. 1119 penuria parvi:
so Democr. Mullach p. 170 26 πενίη, πλοῦτος, ὀνόματα ἐνδείης καὶ κόρου’
οὕτε ὧν πλούσιος ὁ ἐνδέων, οὔτε πένης ὁ μὴ ἐνδέων. penuria is written
with e by Augustus too in his res gestae. 1120 claros vol. se: a
constr. not uncommon in Cicero: see Madv. de fin. 11 102 and Mayor
Phil. 11 14: ib. 19 eupit se audacem: Plaut. trin. 664 cum te maoeume

clarum voles. se atque : for rhythm comp. 1v 809 contendere se atque
parare. claros atque pot: Sall. Cat. 38 1 ita ipsi clari potentesque
fieri. 1124 iter viai : see n. to 11 626. 1127 vaporant is used here

in a peculiar sense, analogous to that in which he always uses the subst.
vapor: Livy V111 31 7 invidiam tamquam iynem summa petere3 XLV 35 5
intacta invidia media sunt& ad summa firme tendit3 OV. rem. 369
Summa petit livor ;...›S'mmna petunt demto-a fulmina missa Iovis.

1130 ressere imp. ε an expression found in Aen. VI 851 3 Livy 111 15 7 ;
vul 23 93 Sen. Phoen. 3743 Hipp. 6212 Med. 2163 Pliny epist. VI 16 4.
1131 sanquine sudent: this fine expression is used literally v1 1147
Sndabant etiam fauces . . sanquine: Enn. trag. 213 terra sudat sanquine ;
Livy xxvn 4 14 quattuor siyna sanquine multo diem ac noctem sudasse3
and such a notion as this may have given occasion to Lucretius' use of
the word. 1133 sapiunt al. ex ore: cannot therefore know the true
nature of things, and must always animi incerto errore vayari.

1134 eac aud.: Plaut. Bacch. 469 vidi, non ea: audito aryuo.

1135 Nec mayis cet: he recalls himself from his digression into the
matters of his day to the subject in hand, the early state of the
world.
