Si non . . quod : see n. to 1 176. illorum neut. may mean the females,
according to Lucretius' usual practice when the reference is to different
genders volucres armenta cet. subat in good writers seems always to be
said of the female in heat. 1205 Quom interea seems a harsh elision3
and none other like it is found in Lucr. ; for 11 850 Quoad licet is a syni-
zesis: Virg. ecl. 111 48 Si acl vitulam, and this eclogue appears to be one
of his earliest3 in Catullus such elisions are frequent 5 64 305 he has
Cum interea, as Lucr. here: 809 contendere se atque parare, the elision
seems to have a similar effoctj, and 1145 cavereque ne inliciaris. [Comp.
Lucil. xl 13 non contemnere se et cet. But probably quom interea
‘while all the time’ was so common a phrase that the words could not
well be separat-ed: for this use of quom interea, interim see Autenrieth

1209—1232: according as the seed of the man or woman prevails at
conception, the child is more like to the one or to the other3 and this is
so whether the child be male or female. 1209 comm. cet. i.e. comm.
semine suo virili semine: but commiscendo semen would make the constr.
simpler and be perhaps more in the manner of Lucr.: comp. 1 1026,
111 1087, v 722. 1210 vim vicit vi: in a very similar passage of
Hippocr. de genit. 7 ἐκρατέετο is used in the same way3 comp. too Plut.

α’νδρός, τῷ ἀνδρί ; Censor. de die nat. 6, p. 16 13 refers this theory to
Anaxagoras: Anaaeaqoras antem eius parentis faciem ‘referre liberos
iudicavit, qui seminis am plius contulisset. Epicurus may have got this
as many other things from him3 but Hippocrates, whom Lucr. had
evidently studied‚ de genit. 7 and S teaches precisely the same ; comp.

perhaps right, as Cicero and the older writers usually have a gen. of
living thingS, especially men and gods, while with inanimate things the
gen. and dat. are employed promiscuously: the dat. in later writers
became almost universal : 1218 Lucr. has similes avorum 3 11 909 simili
