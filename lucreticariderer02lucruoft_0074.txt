diti: on the other hand v 1115 Divitior-is: he nowhere else uses either
form. 414 tarda surely agrees with senectus: see n. to v 1414.
415 vit. cb: this metaph. he twice repeatS, 111 396 maqis est animus vitai
claustra coercens 3 vl 1153 vitai claustra lababant: comp. too Cicero's
words cum ⁶90 claustra nobilitatis refreqissem. The words imply those
bars and defences which have to be forced and broken open before body
and soul can be severed and life destroyed.

418—448: all nature then consists of body, and void in which body
moves: deny the existence of body, you take away the foundation on
which rests all reasoning about abstruse things: without void no motion
is possible as Ι have just shewn. There is no third nature distinct from
these two: if a thing can touch or be touched, it is of the class of body3
if it cannot, of void: neither sense nor reason can grasp any third class,
418 repet. pertemere: v1 936 repetam commemorare, the same constr.: in
both cases the inf. is for the accus. He uses the inf. for a subst. in the
nomin. often: see n. to 331 : sometimes for the accus. as 1v 245 internos-

Volvere in ore licere et caeli templa tueri, where a second infin. depends
on the first used as an accus, subst: repet. then has precisely the force it

and has misled editors: IV 199—-204 si, quae...QuicZ quae suut igitur 3

passages Lach. has gone wrong3 as the older editors have in the present

Eryo. Sometimes too Lucr. places iyitur late in the sentence; 11 678,
where the partic.=a protasis, it is the 7th: vl 1246 erqo comes 5th,
11 569 itaque 5th in the sentence, lv 705 4th: V1 1277 euim is the 9th
word, 1 219 and vl 701 the 5th in the senteuce3 it often comes fourth

Lach. joins it: ut est has no force alone, and the assertion would contra-

ity with which Lucr. says 445 tertia per se Nulla potest cet. : see too 422
440 and 459 Tempus item per se nou est and 466 and 479: from all which
it is clear Lucr. does not deny that ‘accidents' are, but denies that they
exist by themselves, per se. See too Epicurus’ own words in Diog. Laert.
