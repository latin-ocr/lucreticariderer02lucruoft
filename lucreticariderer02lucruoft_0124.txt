1083—1113: again they teach that while earth and water tend to
the centre, air and fire fly from it, and that the earth sends up food to
the tree-tops: they thus contradict themselves: the truth is that the
whole of this doctrine is alike false 3 for, space being infinite, if matter
were finite, the world and all that is in it would in a moment dissolve
into their first-beginnings: if on any one side matter fails, the door of
destruction is opened to all alike.-Zeno 1. l. thus teaches, οὐ πάντως δὲ
σῶμα βάρος ἔχειν, ἀλλ’ ἀβαρῆ εἶναι α’έρα καὶπῦρ· γίγνεσθαι δὲ καὶ ταῦτά πως
ἐπὶ r& τῆς ὅλης σφαίρας τοῦ κόσμου μέσον, τὴν δὲ σύστασιν πρὸς τὴν περι-
φέρειαν αὐτοῦ ποιεῖσθαι κ.τ.λ. : this exactly agrees with what Lucr.
affirms of them 3 who in 11 184—215 clearly and well refutes the theory.
1085 in this v. and the lost one the two conditions of water seem to
have been expressed, when it tumbles in rain from the sky, and when it
is kept together as it were by the earth's substance in the form of the
sea and rivers, 1089 tremere, tremulus, tremor, are all used by him
to express the bickering of the stars or of fires. 1090 cae. caer.
recurs VI 96: he has caerula mundi, the same thing 3 and caerula alone:
Ennius before him cava caerula and caerula caeli templa. pasci:
231 unde aether sidera pascit 3 v 524 Quo cuiusque cibus vocat...Flamwaea
per caelum pascentis corpora passim. 1091 se ibi: the elision of a
long monosyl. before a short vowel is confirmed within narrow limits:
see Haupt obs. crit. p. 17 who cites from Lucr. 1 136, 922, v 97 Nec me
animi3 111 6 Quod te imitari, 1v 1188 tu animo3 1 234 Quod si in eo:
but these are all easy elisions and frequent even in Ovid. Lach. adds 111
574 In se animam, which is a false reading, as well as 1 874 quae alieni-
qenis, v1 755 vi ibus, two mere conjectures of his own which both violate
the laws of elision: see Luc. Mueller de re metr. p. 284. 1094-1101
see notes 1 : it is clear that in the lost vss, the clause nisi cet. had to be
completed; then an apodosis to quoniam cet. must have come, shewing
that these people were not only wrong, but inconsistent: then a new
sentence must have followed, declaring that space being infinite, as even
the stoics admitted, matter as proved above must be infinite likewise, Ne

mundi: see n. to 73 z the ether being outside would go first, then heaven
and air, then earth and all in it would follow and be commingled in
the ruins of heaven. 1105 penetr. templa, the innermost quarters, ie.
farthest removed from us: it means therefore that the whole heaven
would tumble in on earth and be mixed in wild ruin: Virgil has tectis,
and adytis penetralibus, and penetrali in secle3 Seneca penetrales deos ς
Cicero and Catullus have penetrales focos : elsewhere in Lucr. penetralis
