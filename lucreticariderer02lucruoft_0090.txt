82, BOOK I NOTES 11

mam is almost a play on words: it means the universe of things, and at
the same time the largest thing conceivable in opposition to minimam.

have infinite parts and by the old paralogism would be equal, because
all infinites are equal: precisely thus the Indian atomist Kanadi
declared there would be no difference 111 size between a mustard
seed and 3 1110111113111, 3 gnat and an elephant, each alike containing
an infinity of particles ; 566 Daubeny’s atomio theory p. 8 : Henry
More too l. l. argues ‘thus a grain of mustard seed would be as well
infinitely extendcd as the whole matter of the universe, and 3 thousandth
part of that grain as well as the grain itself ². Zeno the Eleatic by
like reasoning concluded that, if things were ‘many', they would
be at once small and great 3 so small as to be without magnitude, so
large 35 to be infinite in magnitude. Bentley in his Boyle lectures
brandishes this weapon in the faces of the epicureans as Lucr. does
against the peripatetics. N ewton in his 2nd letter to him admirably
refutes the fallacy, giving at the same time its 01631651 exposition. As
we shall again encounter this fallacy in Lucr. I will cite a few lines: ‘I
conceive the parallogism lies in the position that all 1116111165 316 601131.
The generality of mankind consider infinites no other ways then indefi-
nitely3 and in this sense they say all infinites are equal3 though they
would speak more truly if they should say they are neither equal nor
1111601131, nor have any certain difference or proportion one to another.
In this sense therefore no conclusion can be drawn from them about the
equality proportions or differences of things, and they that attempt to do
it usually fall into parallogisms. So when men argue against the infinite
divisibility of magnitude by saying that if an inch may be divided into
an infinite number of parts, the sum of those parts will be an inch 3 and
if 3 foot may be divided into an infinite number of parts, the sum of
those parts must be a foot 3 and therefore since all infinites are 601131,
those summs must be equal, that is an inch equal to 3 foot 3 the falsness
of the conclusion shews an 61101· 111 the 111-60115565 3 and the error lies in
the position that all infinites are equal'. 623 Quod quoniam: see n.
