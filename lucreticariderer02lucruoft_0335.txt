florem. 849 debere, the sole instance in Lucretius of a hypermetrical v.;
once only too, 1v 741 equi atque, he elides an iambus: both these licences
are far commoner in Virgil. The elision at the end of a v. is absolutely
unknown to Homer: indeed οὐκ οἶδ’ in an epigram of Callimachus seems
the only certain instance in Greek hexameter verse. Whoever, Greek
or Latin, introduced the practice, must have done it through misappre-
hending *Homer3 for surely his verse is a dactylic hexam. catal. 850
and 856 procudere: see n. to 11 1115. 852 remissis gives an excellent
sense: 1v 1114 Membra voluptatis dum vi labefacta liquescunt: comp. its

clause according to a favourite habit of Lucr.: see n. to 1 15 capta . .

855-87¹7: many races of regularly organised creatures must have
died off, because they wanted either some natural power by which to
protect themselves, or could not be turned to use by man and be saved
thereby: these fell a prey to others and disappeared‚ unable to endure
the struggle for existence. 855 animantum are opposed to the mon—
strous abortions last spoken of: it was not a natural unfitness for life,
but outward circumstances that prevented their continuance. Granting
Lucretius the premisses from which he starts, his subsequent deductions
are eminently able and logical. 856 propayando, 850 pr5pa9ando: he

858 denique here is not a mere idiomatical redundancy as in 1 278 and
the passages there cited, but means, ‘at least' 3 if no higher quality, well
then agility: Hor. sat. 1 2 133 Ne nummi pereant aut puya aut

Lucr. 862 qenus acre le: Ov. fasti 1v 215 cur huic yenus acre,
