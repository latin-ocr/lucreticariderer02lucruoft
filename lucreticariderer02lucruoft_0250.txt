have a like cause? images proceed from things in all directions 3 but as
we only see with the eyes, we only see images where we turn our sight
to them. Again an image pushes before it the air between it and the
eye3 this air all sweeps through the pupil‚ and lets us judge of the dis-
tance of the object seen ; and all this takes place almost instantaneously:
we do not see the images singly, but we see the object by a continuous
succession of these3 just as we do not feel each particle of wind, but the
effect of the whole: and so too we thump the surface of a stone, but
feel fts inner hardness. 233 Cone. causa, since the effect is consimilis.

269—323 (347): the image is seen not at the surface of the mirror,
but beyond and within it in the same way that real objects are seen
through and beyond an open door, namely by two airs: it was explained
above, 246 foll.‚ how the distance of an object from the eye was perceived
by means of the air between it and the eye ; thus you see first the dis-
tance of the open doorway by one air, then comes another air between
the doorway and the object outside, which lets you see how far it is
beyond the door: thus too the mirror and its distance from us is seen by
means of its image which propels before it the air between the mirror
and the eye, which first sees this air, then the mirror3 then when we
have perceived the latter, the image which goes from us to it, comes
back to us, but drives onward an air which is seen before the image, and
makes it appear so far distant beyond the mirror. Again our image in
the mirror has the right answering to our left, the left to our right, be-
cause on coming against the mirror it is dashed straight out in the
reverse direction, like a wet plaster-mask thrown against a post. Again
a series of mirrors disposed in a certain way can bring into view all the
recesses and turnings of a building. Again concave mirrors shew our
image with right answering to right, left to left. Again the images step
