sanie ε Celsus v 26 20 est enim quaedam sanies quae vel ἰχώρ, vel μελίκηρα
nominatur: ἰχώρ is a hippocratean word and is often used by Aristotle
for the serous part of blood, as here by Celsus: now comp. Arist. part.

λημένον. 867—8'74 a similar dilemma, which the lost VSS. render
obscure: trees and the like grow out of the earth 3 therefore the earth
consists not of ὁμοιομερῆ, but of minute trees and the like: fiame smoke
ash are latent in wood; therefore wood consists of minute flames etc. not
of ὁμοιομερῆ : again trees when above ground are fed out of the earth: if
the earth consists of ὁμοιομερῆ, then trees are fed and increased by things
not ὁμοιομερῆ 3 and similarly of the flames which are seen to be fed by
wood. 870 Pransfir: Cic. de off. 1 51 quod ab Ennio positum in una

875—896: Anaxagoras tries to extricate himself by assuming that
everything is latent in everything 3 but that that only is perceived, of
which the like particles are most numerous and most prominent: a.
manifest fallacy3 for then corn, graSS‚ water, clods, wood would shew
when reduced to small fractions traces of blood, milk, fire, etc. i.e. por-
tions of things fed by or produced from them respectively ε the truth is
that the seeds of things have no qualities like to those of things in
being. 875 lata: comp. Cic. de fin. 11 107 si tuam dicerem, latebram
habere33 [Seu. rhet. controv. praefat. 1 1 21 ipsa enim actio multas latebras
habet] Notice latitandi and 877 latitare in two different senses with
nothing in common. Lucr. like the old Latin writers generally, loves
as we have said assonance alliteration antithesis and the like so dearly,
that often the use of a word seems to suggest to him a repetition of it,
without any point whatever, and therefore to our taste faulty z see n. to

be a sorry subterfuge, was in fact the very corner-stone of Anaxagoras'
