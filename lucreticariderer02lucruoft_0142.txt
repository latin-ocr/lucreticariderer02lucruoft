134 BOOK II NOTES II

‘morte mali cum primis hoc sit eorum 3 196 Namque papaveris aura potest
suspensa levisque Coqere ut ab summo tibi diffluat altus acervus, to bring
into relief the papaveris3 v 65 Ut milei mortali consistere corpore mun-
dum Nativomque simul ratio reddunda sit esse : 572 Forma quoque hinc
solis debet filumque videri, Nil adeo ut possis plus aut minus addere, vere,
is very similar to our passage.

251—293: again if there is no such declination of atoms to break
the eternal sameness of their motions, the perpetual sequence of cause
and. effect, whence have all living things freewill? whence can we
change our motions at pleasure? thus horses cannot start in a race at
once: motion has to spread from the heart through the limbs: thus
too when we are carried along by an external force, there is some-
thing in us which resists, and enables us sometimes to stop: while
the weight then of atoms enables them sometimes to withstand the
external force of blows‚ it is only this declination of atoms at quite
uncertain times and places which gives the mind its freedom of action.
251 foll. Cic. de fato 23 states this as the chief motive with Epicu-
rus for devising this tertius quidam motus ecrtra pondus et plaqam:
lianc Epicurus rationem induxit ob eam rem, quod veritus est ne, si
semper atomus qravitate ferretur naturali ac neccssaria, nihil liberum
nobis esset, cum ita moveretur animus ut atomorum motu coyeretur3 and
Epic. himself in Diog. X 134 ἐπεὶ καὶ κρεῖττον ἦν τῷ περὶ θεῶν μύθῳ κατα-
κολουθεῖν ἦ τῇ τῶν φυσικῶν εἱμαρμένῃ δουλεύειν-...ἦ δ’ ἀπαραίτητον ἔχει τὴν
ἀνάγκην. 252 ordine certo, i. e. if they move straight down by in-
herent gravity and only change their motion by palaque, or collision with
other atoms. 258 prom-edimur we men for instance among other
living beings. Epicurus always passionately maintained the doctrine of
freewill in opposition to the everlasting necessity of Democritus as well
as most of the stoics, τῆς ἀιδίου κινήσεως μηχανώμενος ἐλευθερῶσαι καὶ
ἀπολῦσαι τὸ ἑκούσιον, ὖπὲρ τοῦ μή καταλιπεῖν ἀνέγκλητον τήν κακίαν, says
Plut. de repug. stoic. 34, p. 1050 O. 262 rigantur, spread over the
body like so many rivi : comp. Ν 907 somnus per membra quietem Inri-
9et with Furius in Macr. sat. VI 1 44 mitemque rigat per pectora som-
num: Aetna 385 quaecumque riyant incendia silvae. 263 Nonne
vides cet. has suggested his simile to Virgss, geor. 111 103 Nonne vides,
cum...ruuntque effusi carcere currus cet. tempore puncto : a favourite
phrase of his: vl 230 puncto in tempore : it=puncto temporiS, i.e. while
the smallest point of time is pricked down or marked. 265 de subito
recurs 111 643. 267 conquiri i.e. be sought out and brought into
communication one part with the other. 269 corde the seat of the
animus. 270 id seems to refer to the preceding v.: creatum hunc
initum motus: comp. id in Plaut. aul. 8, 10 and 265: then perhaps
motum alone is the subject of dari. 2¹71 Inde...porro: Wak. com-
pares Aen. v 600 hinc maxima porro Accepit Roma : 1 461 porro deinde
