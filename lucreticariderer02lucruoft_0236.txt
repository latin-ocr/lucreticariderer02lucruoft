does not hesitate to say transit et; take audent fundunt or any other
word of the same quantity ancl see how the case stands with them.
It may be said on the other side ‘why is not exiit or transiit used by
Virgil in the 5th foot‘l’ but these words only occur five times 3 and I
find that he uses audiit 13 times in all, 11 times in the first foot3 of the
two exceptions one is a case of repetition, Audiit . . audiit amnis. It is
however possible that Virgil so placed these words as to give his readers
the choice of taking thern for a dactyl or spondee, as they pleased.
Ovid’s exceptional and repeated lengthening of interiit abiit rediit etc.
as well as petiit seems done in defiance‚ as if he would say ‘whoever is
afraid to lengthen these words, I am not': his example appears to me
rather to go against than support Lach. ; nor is the rerlieit venieit occa-
sionally found in old inscriptions any ‘firmissimum argumentum’: 3ἱὸοἱ
ubei ibei m'set qua-sei occur in the new corpus inser. more than 100 times,
fueit posedeit probareit are also found; yet Virgil surely might use all
these short. Laeh. quotes redieit from the titulus Mummian.; but the

former opinion. Lucr. three times uses the contracted perf. of the first

instances rests on a conjecture, though a highly probable one.
