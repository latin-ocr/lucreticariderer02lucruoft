Extima: the ab rebus of 163 shews of course that it is oris rerum of
which he is speaking. 167 res, the images, which are res or real

things in being, as much as the things from which they come: 160 celer

respondent i.e. oris of the thing from which the iniages come. 168-
175 these vss. appear to me to have nothing to do with the συστάσεις
of 129-142‚ with which Lach. connects them: the sense is obscure
and briefly put ; but they are a continuation of the argument imme-
diately preceding, and illustrate quamsacz'li et celeri ratione images are
produced3 for the clouded sky can only be seen by means of them, and
each image forms an inexpressibly small part of the whole. 168 caeli

Arat. 252 late caeli lustrare cavernas, and Varro in Nonius p. 46 Nubes
aquali friyido velo leves Caeli cavernas aureas subduxerant: Varro de

that doubtless his own cavernas had reference to this derivation of caelum.

rum quantula cet.: and therefore the images being so prodigiously thin,
what a number must leave in order to impress our sense on earth.

175 eam rat: the ratio between the imaqo and the overcast sky is such
that no sum can express it.—Comparing what precedes, esp. 163—167, I
certainly take the meaning to be: sometimes we see a bright sky covered
in a few moments with thick clouds: well, the sky is so covered first3
and then we see it by images shed from the clouds, which, singly in-
visible, only become visible by continuous repetition, the ratio of their
thickness to that of the clouds being something so small as to be almost
'inexpressible by words or figures: how inconceivably numerous then
must they be for so many to have reached us in so short a time! But
Prof. Mayor writes to me: ⁴ Lucr. is speaking, 164 165, of two things,
the rapidity with which these images are forming and their universal
diffusion: quantula pars seems not to relate to the thinness of the image
of these faces of horror, but to its narrowness as contrasted with the
