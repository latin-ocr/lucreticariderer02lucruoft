Vis obeat: donec and donique ‘until' in Lucr. take an indic. with
the exception of 1v 997 Donec. . redeant3 and this is the usual constr.
in the older writers: the word is scarcely found in Cicero, though
usque eo, donec..venimus has been pointed out to me in the Verr.
(2) 1 17: v 178 donec is ‘so long as': in 11 950 Ι am inclined to
take solz-it to be a perfect, with a change of constr. in next v.: the
tense of the indic. will then always be the perf. except v 997 Donique
privarant, where the pluperf. seems to be an attraction of the pree.
imperfects. For the usage of Tacitus, who employs the word very often,
see Woelfflin in the philologus vol. 27, p. 127. 224 videri here has the
force of esse, which φαίνεσθαι so often has in Greek: 262 it has its usual
sense of ‘to seem’, and 270 it is a simple passive of video: Lucr. uses
homonymes in this way again and again without its appearing to strike
him that there can be any ambiguity: We meet for instance in the same
or in contiguous vss. with corpora in its ordinary sense and in that of
atoms; as 11 714 multaque caecis Corporibus suffiunt e corpore: res and
ratio are likewise found with quite different meanings. 227 lumina
vitae occurs again more than once 3 it is also used by Virgil. 228 Red-
ducit always has this quantity in Lucr. and generally this spelling in
AB: the same is true of reccidere which occurs thrice, redducere occur-
ring four times: the ancient and sole 1118. of the last 5 books of Livy has
redducit, redducendi‚ redducturum, but reductum 3 Plautus and Terence
always redduco, at least where the verse shews the quantity: comp.
reddo: but Menaech. 520 recident 3 whereas Ovid Propertius Juvenal
(Virgil does not use the word) have reccido 3 but most hexameter and
other poets reduco: the perf. reppuli repperi rettuli reccidi are of course
necessarily long. 230 inqenuei is almost sui: comp. VI 613 Adde suos
fontis of the sea: Auson. Mosell. 65 sub inqenuis affl'tatae fontibus
herbae: Plaut. miles 632 unites sua sibi inqenua indoles, i.e. nativa.
externa is the opposite of this, ‘which come from without', adventicia:

contrasted, as inqenuez' and externa here: comp. too J ην. 111 20 nec inqe—
nuum violarent marmora tofum, who was prob. thinking of OV. met.
111 160 levibus tofis nativum duxerat arcum. Sense and context so
imperiously require mare to be the accus, after supped. that I now con-
cede it, my attention having been directed to Cic. in Catil. ΙΙ 25, si
omissis lais rebus quihus nos suppeditantur, eyet ille 3 which Halm ad 1.
says is the sole instance in Latin of this constr. and which is confirmed
by Arusianus Messius who quotes it in support of ‘suppeditor 1166 re'.
This constr. in Cicero and Lucr. may be an example of what was more
