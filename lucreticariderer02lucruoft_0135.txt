shew that it was a very old legal term, which passed into the common

what is invisible is said to be below our sense: 111 274 Nec maqis Ιιασ

the most modern theories of the most advanced thinkers: see N.

‘the opinion that the observecl properties of visible bodies apparently at
rest are due to the action of invisible molecules in rapid motion is to be
found in Lucretius’. In his Introductory lecture p. 21 he says ‘in-
vestigations of this kind, combined with a study of various phenomena
of diffusion and of dissipation of energy, have recently added greatly to
the evidence in favour of the hypothesis that bodies are systems of
molecules in motion'. Martha too, p. 287, is worth reading: Lucr. he
tells us, had a glimpse of that great principle of modern physics which
teaches that the general forces of nature never are at rest even in the
inorganic world: we do not see this perpetual movement of the atoms in
bodies, because our eyes are too gross to apprehend it.

142—164: the sun rises, and the world is at once clothed in light,
yet its rays are complex, not single, and do not pass through a void: how
much more swiftly then must first—beginnings move! since they travel
through a perfect void and trave} singly‚ and each is one indivisible
whole. 144 Primum cet.: Aen. lx 459 Et iam prima novo sparqebat

understood primum of time, not of order. 145 var. vob: see n. to 1

his Aratea uses I find convestire or vestire 5 times of light: Lucr. has
prob. borrowed this, as many other expressions, from him: Aen. v1 640
lumine vestit: par. lost 111 lO as with, α mautle didst invest. 150 vapor,
vapores, etc. occur very frequently in Lucr. and always in the sense of
beat. 152 aerias quasi...undas 1.0. 13110 air which offers a resistance
like waves of water. [154 complexa: see n. to v 922] 155 there
is at once an internal and externa] hindrance to absolutely swift
motion. inter se φοίνικι they pull and are pulled back, because in one
ray there is an enormous number of atoms combined. extra: see 151.
