passages he has not yet edited. 622 Hoc ubi cet.: that this was also
the doctrine of Democritus is abundantly shewn in Theophr. de sensu et
sensil. 65, 66, 67 and elsewhere. 624 Umida sudantia is very Lucre-

num in pectus templaque mentis: see n. to 1 12οῑ the linquai templa may
have reference to the shape and position of ,the palate and the Greek
οὐρανός. 627 fine: tenus, a use illustrated by Bentl. to Hor. od. 11

might add others from Plautus, Ovid etc.

633—672: Ι will now explain why what is one creature's meat
is another’s poison: all creatures differ within and without ς therefore
they consist of different atonis 5 and the atoms being different, the pores
and passages of the whole body, and also of the mouth and palate must
differ: thus if food is pleasant to one creature, its smooth elements must
suit the pores of that creature ; if unpleasant, then its rough elements
must inore readily adapt themselves to them ; and thus in disease, what
was before sweet to a man may become bitter. 633 almus: 11 390
liquor almus aquarum. 634 quareve: see n. to 1 57 Quove. triste:
see n. to 1 944. 635 perdulce appears not to occur elsewhere. 636
differitas: see n. to 1 653: this however is a most strangely formed
word: [it occurs again and again in Arnobius.] 63¹7 ali recurs
vl 1226 quod ali dederat 3 alei is found twice in the corp. inser. Lat.
and ali in one doubtful case: see also n. to 1 263 alid. fuat we

here: Theophr. de sensu et sensil. 63 σημεῖον δὲ ὥς οὐκ εἰσὶ φύσει

ἄλλο καὶ ἐν ἄλλοις, ὥς φησιν; G. H. Lewes' physiol. of common life
p. 59 ‘that one man's meat is another man's poison is a proverb
of strict veracity'. 638 serpens : Pliny v11 15 cited by Lamb., and
xxvln 35 gives similar accounts of the power of human spittle over
serpents 3 and Hardouin illustrates them from various sources. 639

mentions the same fact, as de temperam. 111 4 at end καὶ τοῖς μὲν ὄρτυξιν
