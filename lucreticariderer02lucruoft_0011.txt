TO NOTES ΙΙ 3

nor would Suetonius himself have omitted it. Nor can I perceive the
least interna] probability in favour of Quintus, who in those very
months must have been thinking more of the art of war than the art of
poetry; for in the summer of 700 he was fighting as Caesar's legate in
Gaul and Britain. And why should not Marcus be the editor? he does
not appear to have been very actively employed during those months ;
and moreover he was one of those busy nien who always find time for
any fresh work they are called upon to do. It may have been a dying
request of the poet's3 for it is more than likely from what he says
of Memmius that he would look on Cicero with admiration and esteem
him as the saviour of his country. Oicero’s virtues and abilities were
just of the sort to excite the love and wonder of a retired student, who
is more apt in practice to overrate than undervalue those who are
engaged in active life, whatever his speculative sentiments may be. And
here we are not left solely to conjecture: the many imitations we find in
Lucretius of the few hundred extant lines of Cicero’s Aratea prove, little
as it might have been expected, that he looked upon this translation as
one of his poetical models. Cicero, though he set small store on Epicu-
rus and his system, was on terms of intimate friendship with the lead-
ing epicureans both Greek and Roman : to one of them, Philodemus as
it now appears from the Herculanean fragments recently published, we
know he was greatly indebted in his de natura deorum. And if Lucre-
tius were quite unknown to him, a word from Atticus or even from
Memmius would have made him undertake what would seem so slight a
task to a man of his lahorious and energetic habits. The poem must
have been given to the world exactly as it was left by the author, with
nothing added or taken from it to all appearance. If Cicero then was
editor, he probably put it into the hands of some of his own amanuenses
or entrusted it to the large copying establishment of Atticus ; and he
may have spent only a few hours in looking over it or hearing it read to
him : 'his name rather than his time was probably wanted by the friends
of Lucretius. All this would of course be the idlest guess-work, if it
were not for the express statement of J erome, that is of Suetonius, that
he was editor, a statement which is in some measure confirmed by the
younger Pliny, epist. 111 15, who thus writes to his friend Proculus,
Petis ut libellos tuos in secessu qurtm examinemque an editione sint (liqui,
adhibes preces, adleyas eaeemplmn ,· roqas etiam ut aliquid subsecivi
temporis studiis meis subtraham, inpertiam tuis . adicis M. Tulli um
mira beniy‘nitate poetarum iriyenia fovisse. The eacemplum in question
may well have been the poem of Lucretius: Cicero in truth may have
stood in much the same relation to our poem that Augustus did to the
Aeneid, patron more than actual editor. Such a function might be a
compliment either to the author, as in tho case of Lucretius and that
mentioned by Pliny3 or to the editor: coiiip. Prohus' life of l’vrsiiis
