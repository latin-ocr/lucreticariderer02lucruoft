aequo auimo : cet. cet. Virgil’s fondness for similar artifices is probably
in great measure derived from Lucretius. After Virgil's time they
appear to be less frequent in Latin literature : people probably got tired
of them, as has happened in other literatures. This love of assonanoe in
all its shapes our poet indulges to such an extent, that his ear and taste
appear not unfrequently to have become blunted by satiety: often within
the compass of two or three lines he will use some of his favourite words,
such as res ratio or corpora, three or four or five times, without there
being any point 01· force whatever in their repetition. The most glaring
examples are pointed out in their places. Many other modes of pro-
ducing effect might be noted in Lucretius, such as his habit of putting
together substantives without any copula: Prata [cecus rivos seyetes 3 Ossa
cruor venae calor umor viscera nervi 3 Aera solem iquem terras animalia
frzqqis 3 varios coneaeus pondera playas Concursus motus 3 Concursus
motus ordo positura fimique, Volneribus clamore fuya terrore tumultu:
but let the examples given suffice. In his alliterations and assonances as
well as in the rhythmical movements of his verse and the style and colour
generally which he imparts to his poem Lucretius seeks rather for the
most direct and obvious means of producing effect, than for the more
subtle and recondite arts of Virgil. His ornament therefore is apt
sometimes to be in excess, sometimes to be deficient 3 yet even the
plainest and most prosaic parts of his poem shew a sincerity of thought,
a force of reasoning and a racy idiomatic flavour of style which render
them less dull and uninteresting than the flatter portions of many more
carefully elaborated works.

Another point of resemblance between Lucretius and the older
writers must not be passed over unnoticed. The language seems once to
have claimed for itself, and with good reason, the same right of forming
compound wordS, as the Greek always retained. Thus in Lucretius
alone there are forty or fifty compounds like terriloquus horrisonus 01·
tero-tyana T roiuqena cet., many of them ἅπαξ λεγόμενα, such as silvffraqus
fluctq‘fraqus. Now these words are just as regularly and organically
formed as any in Greek : primiyenus seems as legitimate as πρωτόγονος,
terriyeua as γηγενής. But by one of those mysterious laws of language
which have to be observed and not reasoned about, the classical language
soon began to limit this right of forming eompounds, and Lucretius in
this respect too must be pronoun ced decidedly archaic. Virgil is already
much more niggardly in his use of compound words 3 and the tendency
