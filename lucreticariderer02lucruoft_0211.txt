558—594: again body and 50111 depend 101 1116 0116 011 the other:
without the body the 50111 cannot give birth to vital motion, nor can the
body without the 50111 continue and feel: mind and 5011] produce their
sense-giving motions, because their atoms are kept in by the bodily
frame ε this they cannot do in the air 3 01· 6156 the air will be a body and
an animal, if the 50111 6611 move in it as it moved in the body: often
again in 1116 the 50111 seems to fail and to be on the point of going: it is
so shattered together with the body that a more violent shock would
destroy it 3 how then could it exist a moment, not to say an eternity in
the open air? therefore when the body dies, mind and 50111 die. 558
1611. Denique cet. clearly begins a new argument: in the last Section he
shewed that the mind, the mens or animus, not the anima, has a fixed
seat, viz. in the breast, and cannot live away from the body, any more
than the ear or eye3 but there he says nothing 01 the body not existing
without the mind. In our present section he shews the reciproca] de-
pendence 01 50111 and mind and 01 body one on the other: see what is
said of Lachmann’s punctuation in note 1. The soul runs through the
whole body which depends on it, as much as it depends on the body.
There is a striking resemblance between the language here and that 01
32 3--349 3 only the conclusion proved 15 different. 558 vivata potes-
tas: see 409 and 11. there. 559 coniuncta is neut. plur. and must refer
to potestas twice repeated3 yet he usually employs the neut. only when
the substantives are 01 different genders ε this case is very exceptional,
to which I know no parallel3 and harsher than even 11 400 caetra ab·
