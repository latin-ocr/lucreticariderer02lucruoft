notes l for three other instances in which Lach. has corrupted his author
from a vain objection to two participles in such a connexion as this:
Cicero in his Aratea again and again has examples of this, and in the
parts most imitated by Lucr. as 237 Quattuor aeterno lustrantes lumine

changes has these words ‘nam via solis obliqua est, totus obliquus zodia-
cus, lumen solis nequaquam semper obliquum est'; the point of which
so far as Lucr. and the latitude of Rome Berlin or Cambridge are con—

fresh sun is born every day. sic refers of course to 696 quia crassior

here lost ε unless it be so, there is nothing to indicate that he is speaking
of the daily creation of a new sun, as he manifestly must be doing ; comp.
too the similar way in which he concludes his discussion of the moon in
the next paragraph, 748—750 Quo minus est mirum si certo tempore
luna qunitur et certo deletur tempore rusus cet. Among those who thus

705—'7502 the moon may borrow its light from the sun, increasing
as it recedes from him, until, when directly opposite, it shews its full
face3 and again diminishing as it again approaches: in this case the
moon must be a round ball moving below the sun: it may shine too
with its own light, and its partia] or total concealment may be caused
by an opaque body invisible to us getting between it and us in various
ways: or thirdly it may be a ball half bright half opaque which presents
to us all these various phases, as the Chaldees assert in opposition to the
first hypothesis, that of the astronomers: or lastly a new moon may be
born daily, each successively presenting a different phase 3 thus many
