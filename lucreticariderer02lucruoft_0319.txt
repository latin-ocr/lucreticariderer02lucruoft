The last eight verses are to be noted, as bearing not only on what
precedes, but also on what follows in this book about the sun and moon,
and 111 1116 sixth about thunder clouds and other celestial phenomena.
On comparing Epicurus' letter to Pythocles in Diog. Laert. x 84 foll. it
will be found that master and pupi] are in precise agreement on this as
on most matters. The contempt which Epicurus had for astronomers
and other system-mongers and the doctrine he held with regard to μετ-
έωρα form one of the most curious features of his philosophy. Whatever
could be brought to the test of sense and was confirmed by it was true3
all opinions again which could not be brought to such test and at the
same time were not contradicted by it were to be held to be equally
true. Now to apply 11118 10 1116 present question : he says 1. 1. 86 11 18
a certain truth that the universe consists of body and void and that
atonis are indivisible: so with all things ὅσα μοναχὴν ἔχει τοῖς φαινομέ-
νοις συμφωνίαν, ὅπερ ε’πῖ τῶν μετεώρων οὐχ ὑπάρχει· ἀλλὰ ταῦτά γε πλεονα-
χὴν ἔχει καὶ τῆς γενέσεως αἰτίαν καὶ τῆς οὐσίας ταῖς αἰσθήσεσι σύμφωνον
κατηγορίαν. οὗ γάρ κατ’ ἀξιώματα κενσῖ καὶ νομοθεσίας φυσιολογητέον, ἄλλ’
‹Ss- τοὶ φαινόμενα ἐκκαλεῖται, and then he goes on to give this reason, οὗ
γὰρ δὴ ἶδιολογίας καὶ κενῆς δόξης ὁ βίος ἡμῶν ἔχει χρείαν, οἷλλοὶ τοῦ
ἀθορύβως ἡμᾶς ζῆν. Η18 doctrines then of body and void and the nature
of atoms are certain truths which admit of but one explanation because
every phenomenon here on earth attests them, and by most certain in-
duction and reason they can be extended to the whole universe, alike to
what is below and what is beyond our sense. Again it is a certain truth
that the sun is really about the same size as it appears to us to be : see
Epic. 1. l. 91, Lucr. v 564—591 : because from the experiments you can
make with fire here on earth and the fact that so long as it is visible it
does not diminish in size, but sooner indeed loses its brightness, you can
by reason and induction apply these facts to the sun and the stars.
Ι Again that our world was formed nearly in the manner just described
by Lucr. is true, because earth water air and fire of which it is composed
always do and must in like circumstances act in the way they are there
