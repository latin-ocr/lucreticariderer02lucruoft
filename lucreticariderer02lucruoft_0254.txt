γύλον ἐκ δὲ τοῦ σύνεγγυς μείζονα καὶ τετράγωνον, ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον ἀληθεύειν,
ὅτι καὶ ὅτε φαίνεται μικρὸν αὐτῇ τὸ αἰσθητὸν καὶ τοιουτόσχημον, ὄντως ἐστὶ

favourite constr. of Livy, as 111 14 3 quod Caesonis sodalium fuit3 xxn

Terence, as heaut. 1048 quor! (lotis dixi: Catull. 22 21 manticae quod in

Livy there cited. 376 lana craia: fresh wool at the same time con-

379—468: in all this the eyes are not deceived; what they see, they
rightly see3 it is the mind that errs in the inferences it draws: this
applies to thousands of things in which the senses seem to be mistaken;
when we are in a ship which is moving, it seems to be at rest, and things
which it passes to be in motion 3 the stars which are in perpetual move»
ment, appear to stand still 3 if you look down a long oolonnade, the roof
and floor and the sides seem at the other end to converge to a point; out
at sea the sun appears to rise from the water and to set in it; the parts
of a ship under water look bent and twisted upwards3 when clouds scud
across the sky, the stars seem to move the other way 3 if you press the
eyeball beneath, you see all things double3 when fast asleep in a small
room in the dark, you often think you see daylight and are travelling
over wide distances: in all this the error lies in the opinions which the
mind superinduces upon what the senses really perceive. 383 diximus,

adsiduo sunt motu: elsewhere he uses the more common constr. 6336 in
motu: see n. to 1 999. motu 6336 without the adj. could hardly be said 3
but adsiduo implies the state or condition of the motion; and Madvig
Lat. gram. 272 2 teaches that both eodem statu and in eodem statu 6336,
manere may be said. 393 Zonyos: longinquos: Servius Aen. xl 544,
