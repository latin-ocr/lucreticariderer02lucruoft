same. One might suppose that this use began from a wish not to con-
found the relative with quisque: thus 111 34 Quoque modo possint res ex
his quaeque creari would have been ambiguous. As quicque, not quidque,
is the neut. of quisque, there would be no objection to quidque which is
found in v 185 3 yet in 11 64 also AB Gott. etc. have Quaeque3 and 1v

Lucr. has no objection to change to the neut.: 157 res quaeque, 158 quae-
que neut. 3 111 424 Quatenus est unum inter se coniunctaque res est: see
n. to 111 184: this of course has no bearing on Wakefield’s absurd argu-
ment that 190 Crescentes=res crescentes. Luor. like the older writers
generally, does not seem to have felt the ambiguity of perempta in the
neut. coming next to natura z comp. v 1414, 1416 and 1417. 58 qen.

lo‘nqo bello maceria is not unlike this passage of Lucr. who thrice has

other parts of the verb are dissyll. or trisyll. indifferently in Lucu,

Cicero of this use. 61 primis seems in appos. with illis: illis, ut

In order to apprehend the poet's drift, which I seem to myself to see
more clearly now than I formerly did, the whole of the verses from 50 to
135 must be kept in view at the same time. The loss before 50 of more
lines than one apparently has broken the connexion with what precedes.
Lucretius wishes at the outset to impress upon his readers that his pur-
pose in writing is not to gratify scientific curiosity, but to free inan from
the two great obstacles to happiness and tranquillity of mind, fear of the
gods and fear of death. He begins then with saying that he will tell of
the true system of heaven and the gods. This promise he carries out in
a portion of the 5th and Gth books. In the rest of the paragraph he
says he will explain the nature of his first-beginnings : that explanation
fills the greater part of the first two books, ancl is dwelt upon here with
so much emphasis, because they form the necessary groundwork of his
whole physical philosophy. In the next paragraph, 62—79, Epicurus is
glorified for having first proved the vanity of this fear of the gods 3 the
sinfulness of which fear is shewn in the following verses, 80—111, by a
vivid picture of the sacrifice of Iphigenia. And not only fear of the gods
must be banished, but also sear of death. This can be (lone by explain-
ing the real nature of the soul, and the true theory of images, which will
save us from being frightened by stories about hell, and of the return to
earth of the ghosts of the dead : vss. 102—135. These topics are ‹lis-
cussed at length in the 3rd and 4th books. The motive for the seciningly
