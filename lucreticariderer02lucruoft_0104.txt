all mss, rightly, I think3 but Halm reads aspicis. That his atoms do
thus work he will abundantly shew in the second book 3 and indeed it is
reiterated in the next paragraphs 817—829, 902-920. 802 sic=et
sic, and couples this line with what precedes.

803—829: but, you will say, all these four elements are necessary for
the production of things: true 3 and without meat and drink life cannot
continue: the reason is the same in both cases: many first-beginnings are
common to many things 3 and the same by various mixtures motions and
the like may produce the most different things 3 just as the same letters
go to quite different words. 803 foll. you see the earth out of which,
the air into which all things grow 3 the rain and sun by which they
grow. 805 indulyet gives full play to: so Virgil indulgye ordinibus,
liospilio3 and Livy inclalyere ardori militum. 806 tabe nimborum
appears to have much the force of vx 521 nimbi riyantes: the nimbi melt
into water: comp. the metaph. vl 514—5162 but perhaps it is better to
make tabe refer to the trees: the force of the nimbi seems to make them
dissolve into water 3 comp. Aen. 1 173 sale tabentis artus: 111 19 the
nimbi are the actual rain-storms shed from the nubila. tabe: this line

in the nom. plur. after Lach. on the authority of both A and B: the
other cases occur in 11 577, 955, 1155, 1v 452, 1203, 1221, v 216, 494,

among these 14 examples we find indifferently participles adjectives and
substantives: and this quite agrees with all other testimony on the sub-
ject. 809 here begins the poet's answer: yes, and meat and drink
feed the b0dy3 yet the body's first-beginnings are not meat and drink.
