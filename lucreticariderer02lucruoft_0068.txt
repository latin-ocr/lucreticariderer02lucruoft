also points out that, Cic. Verr. 1V 94, an ex aere simulacrum of Hercules
in Agrigentum had its mouth and chin thus worn3 and so Minue.
Felix describes Caecilius as kissing the lips of Serapis. Apul. met. XI
17 speaks of the people kissing the vestiqia of Isis' silver statue, as
to-day in St Peter's they kiss the toe of the bronze statue of St Peter.
It may be presumed then that the Romans used the right hand of their
statues, as Pliny says the Greeks used the chin. 318 the meaning is
by the touch of the great numbers who in passing kiss: the words
rather imply ‘ of those who often kiss’: but it comes in the end to the
same thing. 321 praeclusit: this verb he uses v 373 in its literal
sense of shutting the door against. Prof. Conington and Mr N. P.
Howard have independently pointed out to me that this v. is quite sound
and requires only to be rightly understood: videndi is gen. after natura:
Conington compares Persius v 101 namara medendi. speciem = visum:
comp. 1v 236, 242, v 707, 724 : there indeed, as more than once in Vitru-
vius, it means oculi visum 3 here it means visum rerum eaeternarum.

324 Cic. de nat. deor. 11 142 acies ipsa qua cernimus, quae pupula voca-
tur. contenta is well explained by lv 802 and 809. 325 is rightly
joined by Lamb. with what follows: Lach. Wrongly connects it with what
precedes. 326 mare quae inpendent z comp. Ter. Phorm. 180 tanta te
inpendent mala 3 Lucilius quae res me inpendet, where Festus p. 161 9
says me is for mihi : 1v 568 uon auris incidit ipsas3 where see note: so
v 608 accidere has an accus. [Comp. Lucil. xxvl 5l pectus iuriyarier]
vesco: Ribbeck, Lat. Partik. p. 10, seems rightly to make vescus=ve
escus: it is he says both active and passive, ‘nibbling’ and ‘nibbled off':
he who eats without appetite takes little bites 3 hence vescuszfastidiosus,
Paulus Festi p. 368, Gell. XVI 5 7, Nonius p. 186, Labb. gloss. vescus,
ὀλιγόσιτος, ὀλιγοὸεής, προσκορήςε hence in Lucr. it means ‘nibbling at
and slowly eating away the rocks'. Again it is passive in Virgil's
vescum papaver and vescas salicum frendes 3 and thus we can easily
understand Afran. 315 Ac puer est veseis inbecillus viribus 3 Ovid fasti
111 446 vescaque parva vocant, Pliny VII 81 corpore vesco, and Paulus Festi
p. 379 ‘vesculi male curati et graciles homines'. 327 possis=precisely
potest of 324 ε 11 763 possis, 850 Quoad licet ae possis 3 where I now see
Lach. to be wrong in reading potis es: see 11. to 11 41 Cum videas, and
Madv. Lat. gram. 370 for this use of the indefinite 2nd pers. sing. conj.
or potent: the first ex. he quotes is like our passage in which 'nec
