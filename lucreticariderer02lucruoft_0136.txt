156 Officiumtur, the only instance in Lucr. where a verb which governs
a dat. in the active, has a persona] passive: he twice uses the part.
qffiectus, lv 763 v 776. The licence is altogether rare: Horace has
imperor and invide0r3 Ovid thus uses credor more than once, and
dubitor-3 Virgil has the partic. creditu83 Tacitus credebatur 3 Caecina ap.
Cic„ the auctor ad Heren. and others have persuasus est3 the auctor ad
Heren has also supersedenda causa ; the auctor bell. Hisp. est litata3
Metellus Numidicus illi interdicti: several of these are homely writers.
158 Cum..foris is in contrast with 151 Non per...undas 3 159 ipsa...
feruntur with 153 Nec sinyill. . . xire: there can be no doubt therefore that
159 ipsa, suis e partibus una refers to the primordia, each one of which
is a unum suis e partibus, that is one indivisible whole of parts which
are absolute leasts and incapable of existing alone, as we have explained
so fully 1 599 foll.: with suis e partibus urta comp. 111 545 contracta suis
e partibus [anima] he could hardly without an awkward periphrasis
have expressed what he means without using the plur. una 3 nor is it
any harsher than Cic. pro Flacco 63 unis moribus et numquam mutatis
Zeyibus vivunt 3 or the auctor ad Her-en. 111 33 duplices similitudines esee

down space, so as to continue the direction they have once taken, in

κενοῦ φορᾶ, κατὰ μηδεμίαν ἀπάντησιν τῶν ἅντικοψάντων γινομένη πᾶν μῆκος
περιληπτὸν ἐν ἀπερινοήτῳ χρόνῳ συντελεῖ. The above comparison and
illustration are plain enough in reference to the movement of the
unobstructed atom down space 3 but the atom’s own motion is of the
same speed‚ even when it is caught in the hardest body and can only
oscillate through an inconceivably small space: see above, n. to 98 3 and
below, 297 foll.

165—183: they are greatly mistaken that think the course of nature
could not go on, nor the products of the earth and the race of men be
continued without divine providence: nay I might prove from the imper-
fection of this world that it is not divinely created.—That these vss. have
no proper connection with what precedes or follows; that 184 continues
the argument as it was left at 1643 and that in a finished composition
183 and 184 could not stand side by side, has been demonstrated by
Lach. He shews with as much certainty as if 110 had had the poet's ms.
before him, that 165—183 must have been a subsequent addition which
the author's death prevented him from adapting to the context: in this
state the first editor must have introduced them into the body of the
poem. Lach. has also proved that v 195—234 which fulfil the promise
of 182, are likewise a subsequent addition 3 as well as the cognate argu·
