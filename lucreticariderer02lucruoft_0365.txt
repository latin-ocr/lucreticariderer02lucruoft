sense. Aridus: Virg. geor. 1 357 aridus altis Montibus aiidirifmyor 3
Homer has αὖον ἀύτευν 011(1 καρφαλέον α”υσεν; the aridus sonus seems to
be the sound which is like torn paper or canvas.

121—131: sometimes the thunder makes a noise like the crack of
(100111, when a storm of wind eddies round within a cloud and hollows
it out, until at last it explodes with a frightful crash. 123 mundi

answers to perterricr. of 129.—Epic. himself in Diog. x 100 foll. gives a
brief summ-ary of the possible causes first of thunder, then of lightning,
and then of the other heavenly phenomena, πρηστῆρες etc. which Lucr.
discusses: the two are generally in close accordance.

132—159: thunder may likewise come from winds blowing through
rough branchy clouds3 or froin the wind bursting the cloud by a direct
›onset 3 or waves may break in the clouds, like those on the sea3 or the
hot bolt may fall into a wet cloud and hiss like hot iron 3 or into a dry
one and make it crackle like hay-leaves in the fire3 again the crash of
hail and ice in the clouds compressed by the wind may be the cause.

other hand Est etiam quare possit z est etiam ut possit 3 and is not used
as 730 sic cur, where cur has its proper force. 140 cum haurit: see
