alike by the school of Democritus and Epicurus. 44¹7 448 might

449—482: all other things are either inseparable properties or acci-
dents of matter or void: time also exists not by itself : from the things
that go on follows the feeling of past present and future : the actions done
at the siege of Troy for instance did not exist by themselves, but were
mere accidents of the men there or the places there z without body and
space nothing which there happened could have happened. 449 cluent
is almost the same as sunt, as often in Lucr.: ‘all things which have a
name, which exist'. coniuncta and eventa appear to have been devised by
Lucr. himself to distinguish the two kinds of συμβεβηκότα or accidentia,
the καθ’ αὑτά 01· per se, and those not so: the editors afterLamb. quote a pass-
age οἱ Porphyry and decide that condamm:ovussessnx6†a‚ ευεηίαῑσυμπτώ-
ματα. The truth is that in the passage quoted above from Epicurus, as
well as in 67, 68, 70, 71 of the 531110 letter, συμβεβ. and συμπτ. are
synonymes, denoting either kind of accident3 just as Aristotle uses
perpetually συμβεβηκός both for his καθ’ αύτὸ συμβ. and for the μὴ καθ’
αὐτὸ ; 500 last chap. of metaph. v ,- and Cicero in the passage quoted at 419
uses quaeque his accidant for both kinds. I might cite many passages
from Sextus of the quite indifferent use of the two terms: adV. math. x
221 which bears directly on what follows, τούτων τῶν συμβεβηκότων τὰ
μέν ἐστιν ἅχώριστα τῶν οἷς συμβέβηκεν, ro? δὲ χωρίζεσθαι τούτων πέφυκεν.
οἶχώριστα μὲν οὖν ἐστὶ τῶν οἷς συμβέβηκεν ὥσπερ ή ἀντιτυπία μὲν τοῦ
