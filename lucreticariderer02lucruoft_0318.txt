water passing under a wheel moves the wheel, that is to say in the direc-
tion opposite to its own course. polum is the axis of the sphere of
heaven, and utraque pars is each pole, the north and the south. 514

rotae: Nonius p. 13 ‘austra proprie dicuntur rotarum cadi ab auri-
endo': he then cites this passage: they are therefore seoops or basius
attached to the wheel to lift up the running water: Vitruv. x 5 (10)

fluminis impulsu versatae cet: the modioli answer to the haustra of
Lucr. and the contrivance gives a good picture of what he means: [see
Bleumner, Gewerbe u. Kuenste 1 p. 47 n. 2.] 521 Summania must be
genuine, though a ἅπαξ λεγ. and must have reference to Summanus or
Juppiter Summanus, the god of the uightly sky, to whom as Pliny 11 138
tells us the Romans assigned nocturna ficlyura, as they gave diurna to
Jupiter: the word is evidently connected with meme, Matuta, matutinus,
signifying the god who precedes the mane: Summania templa then Ι take
to be the nightly templa of Summanus, the nightly sky; as Plaut. speaks
of Neptunia templa, i.e. the sea: comp. too Vulcanius Saturnius etc. and
Acherusia templa. Bergk however in Jahn’s Jahrb. vol. 83 p. 506 says
that it is to Summanus, as manes to manus ceru85 and= sublustria 3 as
manus originally must have meant ‘bright, shining ³, and then metaph.
‘ good, propitious '. 522 aliunde fluens alicunde extrinsecus, another
instance of pleonastical language: alicunde is ab aliquo loco, the opposite
of aliquo: so that ali. al ic. seems to be only ab aliquo alio loco, and exirm
secus implies the same thing, the whole phrase being simply the contrary
of the inclusi aestus, the heats shut up in the stars themselves: Plaut.

seems at first sight almost a stoica] doctrine; but is merely a poetical
mode of saying that the fires of the stars are drawn on by that portion

out of the four causes here assigned are given by Epicurus himself in
his letter to Pythocles in Diog. x 92 τάς τε κινήσεις αὐτῶν οὐκ ἀδύνατον
