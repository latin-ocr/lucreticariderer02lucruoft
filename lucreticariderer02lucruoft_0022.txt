1 4 INTRODUCTION

maynam cui mentem animumque and simul hoc animo hauri, in acknow-
ledgment probably of his obligations to Lucretius: they produce a strik-
ing effect in the Aeneid from their extreme rarity: Lucretius again does
not decline spondaic endings as naturai, aeternumque, et mortalis, sint
in motu 3 once even irruenti sium but these are much rarer than such
endings as principiorum, and it is worthy of note that he abstains from
them altogether in the sixth book. On the contrary Catullus and Virgil
use them much more frequently than quadrupedantum eqredieutem and
the like: Catullus luxuriates in movements like these Nereides admi-
rantes, ac moenia Larisaea, fluctus salis aclludebant, and Virgil and Ovid
often affect such terminations to a line as Iovis incrementum, Phryqia
(cymium circumspe-”cit 3 but more in Greek than in Latin words. This
however is no concession to ancient practice, but a modern prettiness
introduced by the school of Alexandrine imitators mentioned above: see
Cicero ad Att. vn 2 1 ita belle uobis Flavit ab Epiro lenissimus onches-
mites. launo σπονδειάζοντα si cui voles τῶν νεωτέρων pro tuo vendita. Was
it scorn of such affectation that made Lucretius altogether avoid such
σπονδειάζοντες in his last book? Other forms of spondaic endings‚ bor-
rowed from the Greek and mostly applied to Greek words, are not
uncommon in Catullus Virgil and Ovid. They need not be mentioned
here, as they generally have something of learned artifice and recon-
dite elegance about them, quite alien to the nature of Lucretius, He
never puts more than two spondees together at the end of the line,
while the other three do not reject such rhythms as Nereidum matri
et Neptuno Aeyaeo after the manner of the Greeks. Lucretius does
not avoid sometimes very harsh and prosaic endings such as constare:
id itu esse. then Virgil has such terminations of a verse as procumbit
humi bos, it is done for effect 3 Lucretius employs them sometimes for a
purpose, oftener without any. He is especially fond of elisions after the
fourth foot like these, perdelirum esse videtur, permutato ordine solo,
miuus oblato acriter ictu, uisi concilio (mite coacto: in elisions generally
he is sometimes less, sometimes more violent than Virgil. One other
point is worth observing: Lucretius loves to have the fourth foot wholly
contained in one word and ending with that word ε in the first 43 verses
of his poem, a highly elaborated passage, more than half the number have
movements like these, quae terras fruyifereutis, not terras quae3 exor-
tum lumina solis, tibi suavis daedala tellus, not suavis tibi 3 tibi rident
aequora ponti, diffuso lumine caelum, yenitabilis aura favoni and so on.
This produces a grand and state]y‚ but somewhat monotonous effect.
Catullus however carries it as far or even farther than Lucretius.
Virgil, though he often uses this flow and with much effect, avoids it as
a rule: he says Troiae qui primus, not qui Troiae3 labentem caelo quae
ducitis annum, not quae caelo, as Lucretius would have done. It must
not be questioned that in the construction of single verses and still more
