80 Boox 1 NOTEs 11

ubi ipsa Cernere iam nequeas : the iam implying that when you arrive
at the atom, it is already far below the ken of sense. Lucr. never tells
us what he conceived the magnitude of his atoms to be, and probably he
never tried to represent it to his own mind : perhaps, if he had known
them, he would have accepted the calculations of an eminent living
authority upon molecular physics, who decides that if a drop of water
were magnified to the size of our globe, the molecules composing it would
be magnified to sizes varying from the size of shot to the size of billiard-
balls. With this passage must be compared 749 foll. where he is blaming
those who refuse to admit a limit to the division of thingS, Cum videamus
id eoctremum cuiusque cacumen Esse quod ad sensus nostros minimum ,
esse videtur, Conicere ut possis ex hoc, quae cernere non quis Extremum
quod liabent minimum consistere in illis: and with both passages Epi-
curus’ own words in Diog. Laert. x 58 τό τ’ ἐλάχιστον τὸ ἐν αἰσθήσει δεῖ
κατανοεῖν ὅτι οὔτε τοιοῦτόν ἐστιν οἷον τὸ τάς μεταβάσεις ἔχον οὔτε πάν·
τως οἶνόμοιον, ἀλλ’ ἕχον μέν τινα κοινότητα τῶν μεταβάντων διάληψιν δὲ ,
μερῶν οὐκ ἔχον...ταύτῃ τῇ ἀναλογίᾳ νομιστέον καὶ τό ἐν τῇ ἀτόμῳ ἐλά-
χιστον κεχρῆσθαι. μικρότητι γὰρ ἐκεῖνο δῆλον οἷς διαφέρει τοῦ κατὰ Τῆν
αἴσθησιν θεωρουμένου, ἀναλογίᾳ δὲ τῇ αὐτῇ κέχρηται· ἐπείπερ καὶ ὅτι
μέγεθος ἔχει ἦ ἄτομος κατοῖ τὴν ἐνταῦθα ἀναλογίαν κατηγορήσαμεν, μικρόν
τι μόνον, μακρὸν ἐκβάλλοντες. Epicurus and Lucr. are each comparing
the ἐλάχιστον or minimum of an atoni with the ἐλάχιστον 01· minimum
in a visible thing. What is the cacumen of Lucr. in 599 and 749?
Epicurus wrote περὶ τῆς ἐν τῇ ἀτόμῳ γωνίας, where he doubtless treated
of the present question : if theu a visible thing has an angular form, the
τὸ ἐν αἰσθήσει ἐλάχιστον or cacumen seems to be the apex of the angle,
which before it vanishes, appears to sense to be without parts and the
least conceivable, and not to belong to what is on one side more than to
what is on its other side: if again the form be spherical‚ the cacumen
would seem to be the outermost surface edge at any point, and so with
other shapes. The same analogy Epicurus and Lucr. hold to exist in the
extremely small, but yet extended atom ε there seemed to them no reason
why a cacumen or minima pars should part off to one side more than
the other, and therefore it would remain in the atom in eternal equi-
poise. Epicurus in his intricate prose might have dwelt on this more
fully than Lucr. could do in his verse : the poet therefore seems tacitly to
assume it and to pass in medias res 3 and he was right in so doing. In
the visible thing however the cacumen seems to be a minimum, in the
atom it is a minimum, so small that nothing can be smaller and exist.
From 11 483 foll. it would appear that three of these ‘minimae partes
or cacumina were the fewest that could exist in an atom. 601 id, the
cacumen of course: it has no parts, but is itself one of the parts of
the atom, having no conceivable existence apart from the atom. 602
minima: in Luc. this word, when it has a physica] meaning, appears
