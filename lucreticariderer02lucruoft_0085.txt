break a solid particle whose parts touch in all the space between them
without any pores or interstices to weaken their cohesion'.

577—598: again we do see things in being: they must have had
first-beginnings: could then these first-beginnings, if soft, have withstood
the blows of infinite time? the persistency too of specific marks in
living creatures seems to prove an unchangeable matter at bottom.

form 3 the instances quoted from Cicero are changed to sanctus in the
latest editions : in Pison. 90 Halm reads sancitum, though the mss. have
all sanctum: he refers to Diomedes p. 368 (370 Keil) 3 but he only cites
our passage, and from Cassius Severus ἔρρε sancitum est. 588 quin
