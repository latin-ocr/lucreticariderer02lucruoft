suis. '791 repetunt seemsziterant: this and the preceding v. explain
the mollia membra movere, so that repetunt has no reference to bracchia,
but merely to the presenting again and again to the eyes the same
yestum with foot moving in time to the movements of the arms and
body. 792 Scilicet introduces of course an ironical reason, madent:
Hor. od. 111 21 9 Socraticis madet Sey-monibus well illustrates the force
of the word, because there is a play there on the literal and meta-
phorical sense z for other examples see Forc. '794 An mayis, giving
what he believes to be the most likely cause. '795 is as we said above
a paraphrase of sensibili: Lucr. means that the smallest sensible time
is about equal to the time in which we can utter one word, and that in
that smallest time are latently contained many rational times, or times
such as the mind can conceive by its reason to exist. Thus in the
smallest thing perceptible to sight or touch are contained very many
things which the reason alone can apprehend‚ viz. atoms or the parts
of atoms. With Lucr. comp. the τοὺς διὰ λόγου θεωρητοὺς χρόνους and the
ἐν αἰσθητῷ χρόνῳ of Epic. in Diog. x 47 3 and with the Cum sentimus id
et cum vox emittitur una comp. 1. l. 33 ἅμα γάρ τῷ ῥηθῆναι ’ἄνθρωπος’ εὐθὺς

foll. the reasoning here is all very good; but neither here nor elsewhere
does he explain the all-important point how the mind is first turned to
any object of thought. When the mind is once roused and the will set
in motion, then it may be said it attends solely or mainly to the images
connected with such object: but why should one image more than any
other image first strike on the mind? this he does not explain: he attri-
buted it Ι presume to accident, and therefore thought it unnecessary to
enlarge upon it: comp. 885 Id quod providet cet. and what is said there.
802 quae contendit i.e. cernere, as Wak. rightly explains it; it comes
therefore to the same thing as, nay is somewhat more emphatic than the
se contendit of Lamb. and Lach. acute Cernere: 810 cernamus acute:
