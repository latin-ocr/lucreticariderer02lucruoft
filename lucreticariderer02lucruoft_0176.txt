causa3 727 Quo fit uti pacto. 1005—1012 comp. 1 767 and what

precedes and follows. 1007—1009 have already occurred in substance
three times: sce n. to 760f011.: they express one of the most essential
of the epicurean doctrines. 1010 penes...00rpora prima: comp.

Ulpian in Forc. penes te amplius est quam apud te; nam apud te est
quod qualiter qualiter ate tanetum penes te est quod quodammodo a te
possidetur: [see too Draeger hist. synt. 1 p. 544 ἓ 254 2.] residere is
also an emphatic word, to be abiding, inherent: see Cic. in Forc. S. v.
1011 quod in summis cet. i.e. the formae colores sensus of 1005 1006.
in summis contrasts with penes, fluitare with residere. 1013 foll.
this illustration we have had again and again in words more or less
like: comp. especially 1 823 where Quin etiam introduces it and connects
it with what precedes exactly as here. 1018 discrepitant res: vl
1105 quia Zonye discrepitant res. Observe the vagueness of res here,
the things or results which come from the different arrangements of
letters, i.e. the words and verses3 whereas in the very next words
Sic ipsis in rebus and 1022 res, res has its proper sense of material
things brought into comparison with the former res or words 3 so
careless is he in such matters: see n. to 1 875. 1021 occurred
1 685.

1023—104'7: listen now to a question of vast moment. But nothing
is so easy that it may not at first seem difficult3 nothing so wondrous
but people cease in the end to admire it. Look at the sky with sun
moon and stars: what more marvellously beautiful? yet the world weary
of the sight cares not now to give it a glance. Fear not therefore the
novelty of the thing, but hear what I have to say 3 and if it be true,
surrender 3 if false, gird yourself to the combat: the mind would fain
comprehend that immensity into which it looks and in which it freely
expatiates. 1024 nova res, that which he enters upon in the next
paragraph, viz. innumerable worlds in the immensity of space. ad

upon as an accus: see n. to 1 331 ε the expression does not seem harsher
than Ter. Andr. 392 nec tu ea causa minueris Haec quae facis 3 hec. 616
