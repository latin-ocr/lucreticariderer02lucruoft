138 BOOK II NOTES II

comparisons are not mere embellishments : they are facts, examples, to
illustrate the law: they place before the eyes what otherwise the mind
would have difficulty in seizing ⁷.

333-38οε know too that these first-beginnings are of many different
shapes: thus no two men or other animals are quite alike3 thus a cow
knows its calf among all other calves3 thus kids and lambs run each to
its own mother 3 thus every grain of corn, every shell is distinct. 333
cunct. ew. rer. = primordia rerum, the cunctarum being equivalent to
prima. 335 multiqertis appears to be a ἅπαξ λεγόμ. : it must come
from multiqerza‚ as the omnigenum of Virgil from omniqena: see 11. to 1
683: Luor. has alieoiiqena terriqena Graiiuyena Troiiuqena 3 but caeeiqeni.
336 337 160111· 723 724, and partially 692 694. 336 Non quo . . sint,
Sed quia nori constant ; this is the regular cousin: ‘non quo, nort quod, 'nort
quia, non quin, followed by sed quia, sed quod, or sed or verum alone,
take a subj. in the first, an indic. in the ’an clause ς VI 71 non quo violari
summa deum vis Possit. . Sed quia tute . . constitues . . Nec. ‚adibis 3 Oic.
de orat. 11 305 non quo libe-nter ‘male audiam, sed quia causam nort liben-
ter relinquo3 so Tusc. disp. II 56 non quod, sed quia 3 Sall. Cat. 35 3 ‘non
quia, sed quod 3 Livy XXXVIII 33 11 ozon quia salvos vellet, sed quia perire
causa indicta nolebat3 Cic. ad Att. VII 26 2 non quiri, sed quia: Ser.
Sulpio. ap. Cic. ad fam. Iv 5 1 non quo ea te fuqere existimem, sed quod
forsitan dolore impeditus minus ea perspicias, the perspicias depends on
forsitan. Lachmann's constent seems therefore not easy to defend. [How-
ever Cic. epist. IV 7 1 mss, give sed quod iudicem, editors iudica] With
ozon quia the best writers sometimes have an indic. in the first clause : 3
Non quia vexari quemquamst iucunda voluptas: so Cic. pro Plano. 783
Livy X 41 12. parum multa recurs several times ε it and parum saepe
are similarly used by Cicero: instead of being feW, the atoms of each
shape are infinite in number, as he soon after proves. 340 prorsum
seems best taken with omuia3 as VI 528 omnia, prorsum Omnia3 but it
may be taken with non in the sense of prorsum non: see n. to 1 748 3
though the other sense agrees best with quaedam of 380. 341 filo:
filum is properly thickness, as 1v 88 suptili praedita filo3 hence size as
here, and v 572, 581, 5893 see Laeh. to v 571. 342 Praeter eat: Iv
388 ea praeter ereditur ire : let them pass before you in review, and then
347 sumere perqe out of the number any of them for inspection, and you
will find they differ. Praeter eat, which I have divided for emphasis,
was suggested to me by Hor. sat. 1 4 25 quemvis media eliqe turba, Aut
ob avaritiam aut misera ambitione laborat. [And so transeo is used by
8611. rhet. controv. I 4 12 quam otiosi, quam securi adulteri tramsierunt
praeter oculos meos] The metaph is perhaps from the sollemnis trans-
vectio of the knights for inspection ; comp. Ov. trist. II 89 vitamque
