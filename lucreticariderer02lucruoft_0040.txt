‘cum hodieque' says Macrob. sat. 1 12 8 ‘in sacris Martem patrem,
Venerem genetricem vocemus’. Why then does Lucr. desert the true
old conception of this god, one seemingly well—suited to his purpose, and
adopt the Greek legend? From the time 01 Ennius at least the Roman
poets good and bad alike borrowed the setting 01 111611 poetry from
Greece: the fauns and casmenae had yielded for ever before the muses 01
Helicon. ‘ Inmortalis mortalis si foret fas flere, Flerent divae Camenae
Naevium poetam’, Naevius wrote 101 1115 own epitaph: with Campanian
insolence‚ Gellius says 3 but well they might weep for 111111, 101 111 him
their Homer died. Mars had now become an Ares, the destroying lord
01 war. Again though Empedocles' poem on nature was much shorter
than that 01 Lucr. and doubtless in many respects inferior, yet to some
extent it was 10 1116 latter what the Iliad and Odyssey were to Virgil,
his technical model. Among the recently discovered fragments 01 Em-
pedocles there is an address to Calliope which Lucr. prob. had. in his
mind when he penned vl 94. Empedocles' two great principles 01 love
and 511116 by whose alternate victory and defeat he personified the cease-
less round 01 nature had evidently a great influence on Lucr. Comp. now
the passages quoted by Sturz Emped. 240 sqq. Eustathius there tells us
that Empedocles made the union 01 Α165 and Aphrodite the symbol 01
1115 love, their release by Hephaestus the symbol 01 1115 hate: Heraclitus
in his allegories declares that Homer, in naming 511116 Α165 and love
Aphrodite, confirmed the Σικελικαὶ δόγματα 01 doctrine 01 Empedocles.
Long as this discussion is, I will call attention to another point:
observe 26 illewmniadae nostro quem tu, dea, cet. and compare the coins
01 1116 Memmii in Cohen's mcclailles consul. and esp. Mommsen’s Roem.
Muenzw. p. 597: it will be seen that Venus crowned by Cupid appears
on the coins 01 11115 Memmius and apparently 1115 elder brother Lucius.
We come to the flatterers 01 1116 J ulii before we find 50 large a propor-
tion 01 1116 001115 01 any family with Venus on them. Martha in his
book on Lucr. published in 1869 (p. 61) ‘propose unelexplication nou-
velle', and draws, Ι am glad 10 566, 1116 same 11116161106 from the coins 01
1116 Memmii which 1 had done, and so does H. Sauppe in the Philologus
for 1865, p. 182. Virgil, who is said 10 have taken it from the Punic
war 01 Naevius, tells us that the Memmii claimed descent 110111 1116 Τ10-
jan Mnestheus Aen. XII 127 Mnestheus is called Assaraci yenus. The
Memmii may have claimed Venus for ancestress, though Virgil reserved
that honour for the ,J ulii. At all events she must have been held in
peculiar honour by them, and Lucr. may have wished to gratify his
patron, by making her his own patron lady. Cohen says p. 112 ‘Hercu-
les and Venus were the objects 01 1116 peculiar veneration 01 Sulla:
therefore we 566 1116 head 01 Hercules 011 1105. 49 and 50, and that of
Venus on 51². Now Cohen mentions two other coins 01 1116 Memmii
which have a head 01 Hercules: and Mommsen p. 642 describes two
