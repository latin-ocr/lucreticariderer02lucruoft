the soul which then was, has perished‚ and that the one which now is,

is newly made. 672 superzinsuper: see n. to 1 649. anteactam

that even granting this transmigration of souls, the soul that was before
birth has really perished, and on entering a new body has really become
a new and different soul: in the above passage he is evidently assailing
the pythagorean metempsychosis, which Enn. ann. 10 thus states, Ova
parire solet qenu' pennis condecoratam, Non animam,· et post inde venit
divinilu’ pullis Ipsa anima.

679—712: if the 30111 0111013 1110 body after it is fully formed, it
should not seem to 110 so mixed up with it, but should have a hole to
live apart in 3 whereas in fact it so penetrates the whole frame that 1110
very 100111 110νο feeling 3 it therefore has birth and dies 3 else it could 1101
be so united with the body, nor being so united leave it entire: but if it
can so enter and then spread itself over the whole body, then must it
perish thus diffused3 even as food transmitted into the body perishes
and then furnishes out of itself another nature: thus the soul that entered
will die, and another be formed out of it 3 thus still the soul will be
mortal. 681 vitae limen: he has leti limen several times 3 see n. to 11

supposes it to enter the body.

713—740: are atoms of the soul left behind in the dead body or
11012 if they are left, it cannot be immortal, since it has left parts of
itself behind 3 if it goes out entire, whence come worms and other living
things into the carcase? but if 301113 001110 from without into these
myriads of creatures, do they each create a body for itself, or enter bodies
already formed? then why make a body, when they are better without? ⁴
disease and cold and hunger come from the body: but were it ever so
useful, they could not make it: if again they entered it already made,
they could not unite with it so closely as to have sensation in common.
