20 BOOK I NOTES II

Horace too and Ovid had carefully studied him: this commentary will
in some degree shew what they as well as Manilius owe to him, though
this last disciple is not worth much. Lucretius thus exercised indirectly
no slight influence on the whole future career of Latin poetry. To pass
to modern times, the Italian scholars of the fifteenth century, full of en-
thusiasm for everything Classical, yet admired no Latin poet more than
Lucretius, Virgil alone excepted. The illustrious F rench scholars of the
sixteenth century, Lambinus Turnebus Scaliger, pronounced him one of
the greatest, if not the greatest of Roman poets. In the seventeenth,
⁴ the century of English erudition‚ he was of course well known to Milton
and has been often imitated by him in the Paradise Lost: he had the
fortune too to be entirely translated by one of the most accomplished
cavalier gentlemen and by the most accomplished of puritan ladies before
Dryden and Creech turned their thoughts to the same task. In more
recent times he has been perhaps less praised and read 3 yet in F rance
he has never been without enthusiastic admirers : it will be enough to

' specify Voltaire in the last century 3 Villemain, Sainte-Beuve and Mar-

tha in the present. Among Germans Goethe never failed in sympathy
and admiration for Lucretius. In this country the most recent account
of the philosophy and poetry of Lucretius is at the same time the fullest
and most favourable and by far the best: Ι speak of that given by
Professor Sellar in the Roman poets of the republic.

1—43 : the poet calls upon Venus, as mother of the Romans, author
of their being to all living creatures and sole mistress of nature, to help
him in writing on that theme3 but first to constrain her lover Mars, the
lord of war, to grant peace to the Romans in order that he himself might
have ease of mind to write, and his friend Memmius leisure to read what
he wrote.

placed in vivicl contrast with that which she bears to the whole of
animate and inanimate nature. Lucr. may have had in his mind
