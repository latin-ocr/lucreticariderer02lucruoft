have thought that the ξυνὸς λόγος alone could discern the πῦρ αἐίζωον,
and that the material fire was as delusive as other things. Surely
Lucr. cannot simply mean that, as Heraclitus held fire to be the sole
clement of things and the only real existence, therefore when sense per-
ceived any other thing, it did not perceive it in its reality: when it
perceived fire, it perceived real existence 3 without his having any ex-
pression of Heraclitus to warrant such a conclusion. Did Heraclitus
teach that the everliving fire represented motion sels-engendered which
in a thousand ways, in the human body and through the whole of nature,
produces heat or fire? comp. with this some theories of the origin of
caloric and the sun's heat: all things else are phases of motion thwarted
and turned from its natural course 3 fire alone gives to sense some appre-
hension of this real fire and movement at the bottom of all things.

firmare animi quicquam ratione queamus 3 Hor. od. 111 6 6 Hinc omne
principium, huc refer exitum: it is a common meaning of the word in
Cicero. 700 quizquo‚ and refers of course to quid : on the infalli-
bility of the senses, one of the foundations of Epicurus' philosophy, see
lv 478—52 1. 701—704 it is usual with Lucr. after going through
some important exposition and giving the more general and recondite
reasons, to finish by some short argument appealing simply to the com-
mon sense of men, or to what they see going on before their eyes: see
759—762‚ 915—920, 984 (998)—90’7 (1001). 703 relinquat: see n.
to 515, and 111 40.

705—733: for these reasons all err alike who affirm that any one of
the four so-called elements, fire air water earth, is the first beginning
of things 3 or any two of these3 or all four, as Empedocles teaches, that
famous poet and philosopher of the famous island of Sicily. '705
Quapropter connects what follows with what just precedes precisely as in
635 ; the things formed out of such elements as fire air etc, are as much
elements as they are. ¹707 principium: see notes 1 to 834. ¹710
‘rerum naturas=simply res: see n. to 11 646. vertier: Lucr. has nearly
forty of these infiffltives, many of them more than once 3 but in every
case the antepenult is long, as is the rule with others who use them, the
exceptions being very rare, as decipiar and egrediar in Plautus, acci-
pier in Novius. '715 Exn iqui, terra, atque anima, et imbri z Lucr. is
very irregular, compared with Cicero, in his use of copulae, mixing et,
atquo, ac, que, in every sort of combination. Often too, as here, contrary
to Cicero’s usage sentences are partly α’σύνδετα, partly connected by copu-
lae: comp. 11 511, 875, 1063, 1084-5, 1v 124, 229, 516—7,v 47, 1283
