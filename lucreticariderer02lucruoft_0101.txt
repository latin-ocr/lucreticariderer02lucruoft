BOOK I NOTES II 93

here is asserted of them exactly what Lucr. objects to, the eum sit nihil
om. in rer. παι. minimum seeming a prose translation of 7 48 3 yet at the
same time is denied the inference that they pass away in nihilum, which
Lucr. below 756 maintains must follow. Empedocles himself 77 and 81
Stl‘enuously denies the same, φύσις οὐδενός ἐστιν ἁπάντων Θνητῶν οὐδέ τις
οὐλομένου θανάτοιο τελευτή κ.τ.λ. and ἔκ τε μή ὄντος ἀμήχανόν ἐστι γενέσθαι
Τό τ’ ἐὸν ἐξόλλυσθαι ἀνήνυστον καὶ ἅπρηκτονε Luer. therefore here as else-
where is refuting them from his own point of view. 749: see the full

and ΠΙ 738, as shewn by N. P. Howard in Journ. of philol. Ι p. 118—
121: in my last edition I had already given ut qai in 111 738, and had
intended to give it in the last two places, before I received ΜΓ Howard's
letter. But he is right I think in attaching the qui enclitically to ut :
the qui is an affirmative particle and has the same force as in atqui:
‘yes that’ or the like: see espec. Fleckeisen krit. Miscellen p. 23-33,
who shews from Plautus that qui often has this force in hercle qui,
edepol qui, ecastor qui, at pol qui: and in quippe qui, in places where qui
cannot be a relative z and in utqui (ut qui he writes it), from the same
passages of Plautus that Mr Howard has cited 3 such as trin. 637 An id
est sapere, utqui beneficium a benevolente repudies 3 capt. 553 3 asin. 505.
It is probable that this qui lurks in other corrupt passages : thus in the
letter of Balbus, an unpoh’shed writer, Cic. ad Att. V111 15 A 2, Ι un-
hesitatingly propose uam illum tanti facio, utqui [qui mss. ut Lamb. eto]
‘nou Caesarem mayis diliqam 3 which would resemble Plaut. Bacch. 283
