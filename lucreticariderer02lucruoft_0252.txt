struck out as described above, and then were struck back by a second
process to its original direction. 316 Circum aqitur: not struck out
at all, but only twirled round so as to face its object. 317 docet : he

wards us. The plane mirror makes the image return back foremost, the
concave mirror makes it face round and so return fronting us' J. E. M.
The phenomenon described by Lucr. in these last verses is quite true
and simple, whatever be said of his explanations of it, on which in·
deed he seems not himself to lay much stress. Editors are strangely at
sea about a very easy matter. From seeing my image turned upside
down in the bow] of a silver spoon Ι hastily concluded, as Ι find Gassendi
has done, that a concave mirror always gave an image thus inverted. A
distinguished mathematical friend has however proved to me both by
optical and ocular demonstration that this inversion is caused by the
vertical, not in the least by the lateral curvature. A mirror, laterally
concaoe, such as I have before me at this very moment, gives back your
image turned as Lucr. asserts, i.e. fae-ing you just as if you were facing
yourself, right answering to right, left to left. Probably the Romans
had metal miri-ors of this shape for the purpose of getting such an image ;
the other side being convex, so as to suggest to Lucr. his comparison
‘lateris nostri'. 323 ad aequos flexus: he refers no doubt to the angle
of reflexion being equal to the angle of incidence3 a fact well known to
the Greek and Roman geometers of his day, of which Lucr. therefore
would not be ignorant. How far it can be reconciled with his general
theory of images, I hardly know: an acute correspondent has pointed out
to me many of the difficulties which such an attempt involves. But the
mathematician just mentioned shews me in what way he thinks these
difficulties may be got over 3 and indeed we see in the 5th and 6th books
that Lucr. was sufficiently indifferent to discordant or seemingly discord-
ant theories standing side by side. My correspondent rightly shews I
think that in 320 recedas refers to a person moving along a mirror paral-
lel to its plane, not stepping back from it. It must be remembered that
the ancient mirrors were but a few inches in diameter 3 and would per-
haps not suggest to Lucr. some difficulties which our large looking-glasses
might have done: 322 Omnia are all objects generally which can im-
pinge, a ball and the like as well as an image.

324 (299)— 378 : this theory of images will explain many other
things: you cannot gaze on the sun, because of the force with which
images come from it, and the secds of fire mixed in them: the jaundiced
see all things of a greenish yellow, because of the atoms of this colour
which proceed from them and meet the images : we see out of the dark
things in the light, because a bright clear air, advancing before the
images of things in the light, purges the eye of the gross air of darkness,
