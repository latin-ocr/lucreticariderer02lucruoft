374 BOOK VI NOTES 11

cet.: Ι 1104 Et ne cetera consimili ratione sequantur, 1107 Inter per—
mistas rerum caelique ruinas: rerum summa here = haec rerum summa,
or mundus, as the context shews: see n. to 1 loos—He loses no occasion
of reminding us how great the delusion of many is in supposing that our
world is eternal: this he has refuted at great length in the early part of
v: our mundus and every other mundus will perish as certainly as the
universe, the summarum summa, will be immortal and unchangeable for
everlasting.

608—638 : the sea does not grow lat-ger, because its size is enormous

compared with the supplies from rivers and springs ancl rain83 the sun
and winds too and clouds all draw off much, as they act upon so wide a
surface; then as water comes through the porous earth into the sea it
passes in like manner from the sea back to the earth.—-Manifestly, as
Lach. shews, this paragraph has no connexion in language and not much
in meaning with what precedes and follows, and must be a later addition
of the poet's, not properly embodied with the rest. 612 riyant in
sense can only apply to terras. 613 acl cet: comp. 679 Nil sint acl
summam; and n. there: Cic. Tusc. 1 40 terram...ad universi caeli com-
plet-um quasi puncti instar optinere. 614 aclauymen : another ἅπαξ
λεγόμ.; 866 n. to 1 435 Auqmine. 615 maynum seems intended by its
position to be emphatic, utpote magnum: then maqnam immediately
follows with his usual indifferencc to such repetitions. 619 pelaqe:
v 35 pelayeque sonora. 626 comp. Virg. geor. 111 360 Concrescunt
subitae currenti in flnnzine crustae, with a quite different application ; as
so often in his imitations. luti coner. cruet: Frontin. de aquis 122
aut enim limo concrescente qui interdum in crustam indurescit cet.
627 docui, 473 foll. and 503 foll. 630 Cum cet.: Aen. x 807 Dum
pluvit in terri8; where Servius ‘si iunxeris Dum pluit in terri-9, erit
archaismos, debuit enim dicere in terras. tamen sciendum hemistichium
1106 Lucretii esse cet.’ : it is better with Lach. to look upon in terris as a
pleonasm natural in an old writer. 631 cum: 866 n. to 1 755. 632
coniunctast, i.e. cum mari. 635—638 =v 269—272, except that for
637 Con-fleat, redit v 271 has Convenit, fluit: the reason of the change
to redit is obvious.

639—646: now to explain the eruptions of Aetna, one of which
struck neighbouring nations with such fear and awe. 639 fauces:
702 he says that fauces ancl ora are the proper Latin terms for cratere.
642 dominata: dominantur, dominatus, dominantior he has already
applied in this book to the power of lightning. 643 qentibus: for the
dat. see n. to 729. 646 moliretur: Cic. de nat. 11 59 nec ea quae
ayunt molientium (ie. deorum) cum labore operoso ac molesto. Cicero
l. l. 96 thus describes an eruption, nos autem tenebras coyitemus tantas
quantae quondam eruptione Aetnaeorum ionium finitimas reqiones oh-
souravisse dicuntur, ut pcr'biduum nemo hominem homo aqnosceret cet. ε
