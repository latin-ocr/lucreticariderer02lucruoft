appears an unusual construction. 569 moventur motus: a grecism.
Epic. in Diog. Laert. x 66 concludes in the same way, ου’ γάρ οἷόν τε νοεῖν
αὐτὴν αἰσθανομένην, μὴ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ συστήματι καὶ ταῖς κινήσεσι ταύταις
χρωμένην, ὅταν τοῖ στεγάζοντα καὶ περιέχοντα μὴ τοιαῦτ’ ᾗ ἐν οἷς νῦν οὖσα.
ἔχει ταύτας τὰς κινήσεις. 573 Corpus enim cet.: he has shewn again
and again that reciproeity on the part of the body is necessary to enable
the soul to begin to act and produce sense. 575 in ipso corp. i.e.
intus in corpore: comp. 605, 506, 483 and n. there: that 576-590 (590—
606) are to be transferred here will be manifest, when it is once pointed
out. 578 velle: lv 518 Iam ruere ul quaedam videantur velle. 5¹79

581 animo malefactum esc, malefic, male est are all found in Plautus3
the last in Terence. 582 animam· liquisse: animus seems more usual
111 this phrase3 as Caes. de bell. Gall. v1 38 4 relinquit animus Sextium;
Suet. 1 45 repente animo linqui.. solebat: Ovid heroid. 11 130 Linquor
ec ancillis excipienda cado. 583 repraehendere: this spelling recurs 8593
in three other instances AB have repreli.: for meaning see n. to VI 569
reprehendere. 585 haec appears to be the fem. plur., Lucr. never uses
lcaeJ see v1 456 liaeo comprendunt, and 11. there3 but haec may be neut-
as 559 Coniuncta. 587 prodita: 11 933 aliquo tamquam partu quod
proditus eaetet. 588 in aperto: Vl 817 in apertum. 589 omnem . .

means of course the (mimus and (eninm, taken as one, and the corpus:
comp. the conclusion of a very similar argument 348 Ue videas quoniam
coniunctast, causa salutis, Coniunclum quoque naturam consistere eorum,
i.e. corporis atque animai.

595—614 : when the soul leaves it the body rots away: a proof that
the soul has come out of its inmost depths, to cause such utter ruin3
the soul then must have been torn in pieces itself, ere it got out of the
body: again a dying man feels not the soul escaping entire from him, but
failing in this spot or that: if the mind were immortal, it would not
mourn its dissolution‚ but its having to quit the cover of the body.

596 in tecet. ocl.: Wak. quotes Aen. 111 228 tum vox taetrum dira inter
odorem. taeter is several times applied to oclor by Luc-12, still oftener to
the sense of taste, sometimes to the sight. in: see 11. to 537. 598
