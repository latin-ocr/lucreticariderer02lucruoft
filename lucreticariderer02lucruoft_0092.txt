84 BOOK 1 NOTEs Π

οἰακίζων κεραυνός, the iynis sincerus et sine ullius materiae permioetione,
ut putat Heraclitus, would seem to Lucr. a mere outrage on nature and
reason 3 and therefore he will have the heraclitean and stoica] fire to be
his own fire. The epicurean in Cic. de nat. ΙΙΙ 35 speaks to the stoic
Balbus in the same sense: omnia vestri, Balbe, solent ad iyneam vim
referre, Heraclitum, ut opinor, sequentes, quem ipsum non omnes interpre-
tantur iano modo 3 qui quoniam quid diceret intelleyi noluit, omittamus:
vos autem ita dicitis, omnem vim esse iynem cet. 635 Quapropter has
clear reference to what just precedes: simple fire as an clement cannot
have the properties which birth-giving matter must have, coneaeus ponde-
ra etc.: this word alone would refute the monstrous corruptionS, ni and
multis, which Lamb. and all subsequent editors introduce in 628 and 631.
638 dux has the double meaning of leader in war, and chief of a sect:
Hor. epist. 1 1 13 quo me duce, quo lare tuter-3 Quintil. inst. v 13 59
inter duos diversarwn sectarum velut duces non mediocri contentione
quaesitum. 639 Clarus: a play on its double meaning, as 475 Clara
accendisset. Clarus ob obscuram: see p. 153 and comp. Lucan. 1 186
imaqo Clara per obscuram...noctem : for constr. comp. Hor. epist. 11 2 32
Clarus ob idfactum3 Mela 11 26 ob multa memorabilis est; Tac. ann. 111
75 ob idfarna celebratior. ὁ σκοτεινάς appears first in the de mundo 5
p. 396 b 20 attached to his name: Cic. de fin. 11 15 Heraclitus coquo-
mento qui σκοτε ινό ς perhibetur, quia cle natura nimis obscure memoravit ;
Sen. epist. 12 7 Heraclitus cui coquomenfecit orationis obscuritas: how
much the term was in vogue might appear from Livy XXIII 39 3 Leyati
acl Hannibalem missi, Heraclitus cui Scotino coynomen erat: which
must have been given in jest. [See Schuster in Acta soe. phil. Lips. 111
p. 355133 and Tertull. de anima 2 (vol. 11 p. 560 Oehler) Heraclitus
ille tenebrosus: a more literal translation than obscurus. If the ‘de
mundo' was later than Hannibal’s time, then the allusion in Livy
would be the oldest reference to the epithet] 639 inania i.e.
Graios 640 Quanide: Festus s. v. quotes this passage and two
from Ennius: ann. 29 and 139. 641 stolidi: 1068 Sed vanus stolidis:
in both cases with reference to the maintainers of stoical doctrines : he
retorts upon them their own term of reproach. adm. am. : Hor.
epist. ΙΙ 2 58 mirantur amantque. 642 Inv. ven: Ter. heaut. 372
has inversa verba, where the meaning is as uncertain as here: Quintil.
inst. VIII 6 44 οἰλληγόρια, quam inversionem interpretantur, aliud verbis
aliud sensu ostendit, etiarn interim contrarium 3 and this sense admirably
suits the extant fragments of Heraclitus. Cic. de orat. 11 261 uses
immutata oratio with this meaning, inversio verborum with that of our
irony. The expression might apply too to words in a forced and
unnatural position, and therefore obscure. 644 fucata sonore seems
a very bold metaphor, worthy of Heraclitus.

645—689: how could simple fire produce such a variety of things‘l
