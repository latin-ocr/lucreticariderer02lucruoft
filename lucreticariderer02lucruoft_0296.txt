ἁγιώτατον, iS added διὸ καὶ μόνον μεγίστην εὐσέβειαν ἐζηλωκέναι φασὶ καὶ
δοξάζειν ὁσιώτατα περὶ θεῶν. 53 de diris: ‘quippe qui libros singu-
lares scripsit περὶ θεῶν et περὶ ὁσιότητος’ Bentl.: Cic. de nat. deor. 1 115
at etiam de sanctitate, cle pietate adversus cleos libros scripsit Epicurus:
they are often quoted in that work of Philodemus. 54 pandere:
1 55 rerum primordia pamlnm; 126 rerum, naturam eaepandere dictis.

55—90: following in his steps Ι teach the inexorable laws by which
all things are bound: having proved the soul to be mortal and shewn
how images in sleep cheat the mind, I go on to prove the world to be
morta] and to have had a beginning, and to describe how all its parts were
formed, what creatures sprang from the earth, what never existed; how
feat- of the gods fell upon rnen: the natural courses too of the heavenly
bodies I will explain, that men may not fancy they are directed by the
gods and be enslaved by religion. 55 Livy xxxvn 53 11 Eumenes
says of his father huius eqo vestiqia inqressus. 58 Nec valeant i.e.
quamque non valeant: but perhaps Nec rather connects what follows
with what precedes in the way illustrated in n. to 1 718. validm
valeant: see n. to 826 sonitu sonanti. 59 reperta est i.e. in 111. 61
comp. 111 605 Non moclo uon omnem possit durare per aevom. 62
simulacra cet: 1v 34 foll.; comp. too 1 133 somnoque sepultis, Cernere
vti videamur eos cet: as far as the general theory of images is concerned,
this topic can form but a very small part of it 3 but morally speaking, to
an epicurean it is the most important of all, as the great end of physice
is to free men from religion and sear of death; hence the earnestness
with which Lucr. insists upon'it. Sed i.e. repertum est, understood
from reperta esc: comp. n. to 853. 63 cum videamur: see n. to 111
736 Cum subeam. quem vica reliquit is the same as qui vitam reliquit:
thus he says both eum mortis letique potitum and quem mors et terra
potita est: Aen. v1 735 and Ov. met. XI 327 vita reliquit. 64 Quod
superest begins the apodosis of the sentence which commenced at 55.
65-81: he here enumerates most of the subjects treated of in this book,
which do not however all follow in the order observed in this summary:
65 66 these questions are discussed 235—415: 67 Et quibus—Lummlque
ylobum, these in 416-508 and 534—563: 69 tum quae—Extiteri‘nt,
this in 783—877: ’ΤΟ ει quae—natae, this in 878—924: 71 Quove modo—
nomina rerum, this in 1028-1090: 73 Ec quibus—divom, this in 1161
—12401 76 Praeterea—ratione putemus, these in 564-770.

67 Et quibus cet.: 416 Sed quibus ille modis coniectus materiai Fum-

darit terram eet. 70 et quae nullo cet.: 878 Sed ‘neque Centami
fuerunt, ‘nec tempore in ullo Esse queunt cet. 71 Quove: see n. to 1
57. ¹72 vesci: Nonius p. 415 ‘vesci etiam significat uti': he quotes

this passage and Aen. 1 546 si vescitur aura Aetheria 3 from Pacuvius
arte hac vescimur and vescatur armis3 from Accius armis vesci and vesci
praemiis 3 and Cic. de fin. v 57 vesci voluptatibus: vesci therefore=frui3
