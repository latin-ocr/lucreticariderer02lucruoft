smaller and go on to the larger: the eodem would infallibly be changed
into eadem by the context ε in Lucil. xxlx 79, if Mueller is right in read·
ing Eodem una (uno mss.) laic modo, the case is exactly parallel. As
Lach. says, eadem unu would hardly have the meaning of una et eadem.
Ι 0 the J ourn. of phil. 1v p. 123 124 I argued for Namque eadem minima
(eadem in una, in eadem una) ; but my present reading is much simplet.
484, 48¹7 and 490 corporis is of course the atom: 866 0. to 1 600 Cor-
poris illius. Lucr. seldom has to speak of a single atom : when he does
mention one, he has hardly any word for it but corpus as here. 485
minimis e partibus: this has been fully explained 1 599 foll.: these
minimae partes, which could not exist alone and had no distinctiva
qualities, Lucr. seems to have regarded as each perfectly identica13 so
that the aton] took its shape and character solely from the mode of
juxta—position in which these existed from everlasting in the atom ; and
three he seems to have thought the very smallest number that could

compose one of his atoms. 490 Formai speciem : comp. 1v 69 formai
fiyuram. 491 Quod superest: see 0. to 1 50. 492 Addemium
partis: see n. to 1 111: the permutations will soon come to an end and
to increase the shapes new parts must be added. 494 eciam, once
again, still, which the comic poets shew to have been an idiomatical use:
Cic. Verr. 111 175 dic, dic etiam clarius. 496 Subsequitur, at once
follows upon. 498 maaeimitate: see n. to 1 653. 499 supra i.e.

1 615 foll. With what precedes comp. Epicurus himself in Diog. x 56
πᾶν δὲ μέγεθος ὑπάρχον οὔτε χρήσιμόν ἐστι πρὸς uie τῶν ποιοτήτων δια-
φοριίς, ἀφῖχθαί τε μέλλει καὶ πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὁρατὴ ἅτομος...πρὸς δὲ τούτοις
οὗ δεῖ νομίζειν ἐν τῷ ὡρισμένῳ σώματι ἀπείρους ὄγκους εἶναι οὐδ’ ὅπηλι-

500 Meliboea: Lucr. tells us that this was the Thessalian town: it
=lay on the shore, between Ossa and Pelion : Aen. v 251 Purpura Maean-
dro duplici Meliboea cucurrit 3 where Conington says ‘Meliboeus is
formed from it as an adj. by poetical licenoe, as 111 401 ducis Meliboei ’.
501 Thessalico conc. col.: see 0. to 1 474. Philostr. heroica 744 proves
that the Thessalians were known for dyeing with purple from the κόχλος.
tacta: Luor. uses continyo and contactus in the same sense. Oudendorp
on Lucan Χ 491 among several false instances quotes 11 536 tetiyit sum-
quis pollutos Caesaris enses. 502 ridenti : 1v 1125 pulchra in pedibus
Sicyonia rident. 504 iacerent of course is continued to this verse:
Lucr. assumes according to wont that where the varieties are infinite
there must be infinitely good and infinitely bad in what they produce.·
505 Lamb. seems to be right in taking Phoebea to imply tunes played on
the φόρμιγξ, the instrument of Phoebus. daedala chordis appears to
be the same as 412 per chordas oryomici quae...fi9urant: both phrases
seem to imply the giving expression on the strings to all the varied forms
of the music. 509 iu melioris depends 10 grammar on cedere retro, in
