possible cases 3 though it seems rather stoical than epicurean: comp. too
Virg. Aen. 1 608 polus dum sidera pascet. 232 debet: this word Lucr.
employs with singular fondness in a very peculiar sense: to denote that
which follows either as a natural or a necessary consequence: he applies
it to all things alike, animate and inanimate: 11 1139 Omnia debet
enim.

comio. 97: Lucr. 111 650 has abstraxe, v 1159 protraxe3 Virgil traxe,
Horace surreme, Catullus promisse 3 many others, dia-e and the like, are
found in Plautus: coynosse remosse cresse 111 Luor. are simpler eontrac-
tions like nosse : 1 987 confluxet: comp. viaeet extinxem in Virgil, erepse-
mus in Horace 3 the abundance of such forms in Plautus and Terence
and the general use of faxo ausim shew that they belonged to the lan-
guage of common life. diecti is found even in Cicero: see Madv. de fin.

more fully enforced: comp. too Cic. pro Cael. 77 iam aetas omnia, iam

he has just enumerated what goes on in the three portions, earth sea
heaven: on rerum summa 566 n. to 1008. 240 indupedita of course

agrees with materies: comp. 244: Lamb. here errs as well as Wak.

241 Madv. Cic, de fin. 11 84 says that satis esset causa Zetizletum satis
efficeret, and that the gen. Zeti makes a difference: [see too Draeger

his new ed. read satis est tibi in te...praesidii for praesidium: auctor
ad Heren. at beg. via· satis otium studio suppeditare possumus, where
Madvig would read otii 3 ad Att. XII 50 si satis consilium quadam
de re haberem, where Lamb. reads consilii: he also refers to Ovid met.
111 149 Fortunamque dies habuit satis and Virg. Aen. XI 366 sat funera
fusi Vidimus. In all these passages satis appears to me to have much
the same force as in Lucr. ‘in sufficient measure' 3 as well as in Sen.
