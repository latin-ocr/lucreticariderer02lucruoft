other with this of anr. makes it highly probable that the illustration
here employed came from Heraclitus: in what relation to him Aeneside-
mus stood is well known ; the other, the peripatetic Strato of Lampsacus
who went by the name of ὁ φυσικός, seems also to have been much
indebted to him. This connection in the present case will appear yet
more probable‚ if we compare Tertull. de anima 14 near end, nore, lonqe
hoc eaeemplum est a Stratone et Aenesidemo et Heraclito ,· ‘nam et ipSi
unitatem animae tuentur quae...per sensualia variis modis emicet: the
doctrine here assailecl by Lucr. is lucidly stated by Cio„ Tusc. 1 46 uos

medici qui ista aperta et patefacta viderunt, viae quasi quaedam sunt ad
oculos, ad auris, ad naris a sede animi perforatae: he adds animum et

est: difficile there, and 111 328 and 330 haud facile est really mean ‘it is
not possible’ according to that common rhetorical device of bringing
your meaning out more strongly by understating it 3 and this is the
sense here. To be sure if you press the word dicere, it is possible enough
to say this or anything else, but then Desiperest is equally out of place,
for the wisest man may says it, as well as the most foolish3 and indeed
‘it is impossible' only means ‘it is absurd': Livy vm 40 3 uec facile est
aut rem rei aut auctorem auctori praeferre: yet literally this is easy
enough to do. 362 Ι now retain, though the v. is obscure and incom—
plete: for this sense of theirs draws on and forces (2 the soul) to the very
acies of the eyes. 364 Lumina luminibus, another instance of false
antithesis : 566 11. to Ι 875. 367-369 he concludes his case here, as
so often elsewhere, with a brief argument addressed to the common sense
of men, which here, as 1 915, takes the form of 6 sarcasm: 566 13116
instances given at 1 984—987. 369 postibus appears to mean the
door-posts together with their fores: so it was understood by Lactant. de
opif. dei 8, where he assails this, as he terms it, ineptissimum arqumen-
tum of Lucr.: quoniam evulsae cum postibus fores plus inferunt luminis.

370-395 z you must not believe what Democritus teacheS, that the
atoms of the soul alternate one by one with those of the body, and are
therefore as many in number: they are in fact not only much smaller‚
but also much fewer, not enough to awaken sense through the body,
which often therefore does not feel very small things that come in con-

136613 with it 3 they not exciting any part of the soul. 3¹70 possis3 see
11. 130 1 327. 371 recurs v 6223 and proves that Democriti goes with
what follows. Dem. sancta sentencia: Lucilius has Valeri sententia

dia, Horace sententia dia Catonis. viri thus coupled with a proper
name and without an epithet is curious 3 its force is much the same as that
