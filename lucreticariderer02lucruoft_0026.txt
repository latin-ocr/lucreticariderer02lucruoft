18 INTssoDUCTION

Cicero's meaning? we have not the criticisn] of Quintus which called
forth the remark to enlighten us. At this period when the νεώτεροι, as
Cicero calls them, were striving to bring the Alexandrine style into
fashion, there seems to have been almost a formal antithesis between the
rude genius of Ennius and the modern art. It is not then impossible
that Quintus may so have expressed himself on this head, that Cicero
may mean to answer ‘ yes, you are quite right in saying that Lucretius
has not only much of the native genius of Ennius, but also much of that
art which to judge by most of the poets of the day might seem incom-
patible with it'. Thus the mss. would be right and Cicero’s judgment
would satisfy us. Again to write either multae tamen etiam artis or
multae etiam artis is hardly, if at all a greater change than to insert non.
Lachmann however has no doubt that non must come before multis: he
says Cicero could not deny to Lucretius art: ‘quod in Marco sane miran-
dum esset, quippe qui eius artis qua Lucretius pollet ne minimam
quidem partem in carminibus suis adsecutus esset. contra idem cur pauca
iozgyenii lumina in Lucretii carmine animadverterit, non potest obscurum
esse: nam ei Ennius et Attius ea re inqeniosi videbantur, quod oblec-
tando docerent et animis movendis corrigerent mores '. But every one
feels that inqenii lumina means here precisely what we mean by genius 3
what Ovid means when he says of Ennius Ennius inqenio mamimus,
arte rudis, of Callimachus Quamvis inyem'o non valet, arte valet, of
himself broken by calamity Nec tamen inqeozium ‘nobis respondet, uc
ante...Impetus ille sacer qui vatum pectora nutrit, Qui prius in ‘nobis esse
solebat, abest 3 what Horace means by iozyem' beniymz vena 3 and I nqenium
cui sit, cui mens divinior 3 what Juvenal means when he says of Demo-
sthenes and Cicero taetrumque Laryus et emundans leto dedic inqeniifons.
As it would not be well then in Cicero to deny Lucretius inqenium, if
we must have a non, I should prefer to see it before multae. Why
Cicero should deny him art, may be explained in more ways than one:
he had a genuine love of Ennius and is indignant that the ‘cantores
Euphorionis' should presume to despise him: he and Lucretius agreed
on taking him for their great poetica] model. At the same time his own
Aratea must have been written thirty years or more before this letter,
and he may well have been so far converted by the almost unanimous
tendency of the poets of the day towards that style of diction and verse
which was gradually leading up to the works of Virgil and Horace, as to
deny Ennius and Lucretius much art. In that early work for instance
Cicero suppresses the final s of short syllables just as freely as Lucretius
does : in his orator written two or three years before his death he says
of this licence ‘iam subrusticum videtur, olim autem politius’. What
remains of their poetry, proves that both Augustus and Maecenas had
formed their style rather in the school of Catullus and Calvus than of
Virgil and Horace 3 yet doubtless they would have rated the art of the
