143—175: images stream incessantly from the surfaces of all things:
some things they pass through, by others they are broken 3 from others,
at once hard and bright, they are reflected back: they stream as con-
stantly from things, as light from the sun, so that as soon as a mim-01· is
turned to a thing, its image appears in it at once: often too the sky in a
moment is overcast with thick clouds: what a multitude then of these
thin images must in an instant be shed from them, to allow of these
being seen by us! 143 foll. Epic. in Diog. X 48 ἡ γένεσις τῶν εἰδώλων
ἅμα νοήματι συμβαίνει· καὶ γὰρ ῥεῦσις ἀπὸ τῶν σωμάτων τοῦ ἐπιπολῆς
συνεχής συμβαίνει...σώζουσα τὴν ἐπὶ τοῦ στερεμνίου θέσιν καὶ τάξιν τῶν
α’τόμων ἐπὶ πολὺν χρόνον κ.τ.λ. and Macrob. sat. vn 14 4 censet Epicurus
ab omnibus corporibus iussi fluore quaepiam simulacra manare, nec um-
quam tantulam moram intervenire quin ultra ferantur inani figsura
cohaerentes corporum exuviae: Plut. def. orac, 19 explains the πολὺν
χρόνον, by saying how ludicrous it is that these idols should appear in
all directions during ἀπλέτους ἐτῶν περιόδους, often when the beings
from whom they emanated have long been burned on the fire or have
rotted in the earth. 146 alias is most simply taken for ‘other
things', except those mentioned afterwards3 when the turn of the argu-
ment in 150 causes perhaps a slight anacoluthon: it might be ‘some’, as
if he had intended a second or third alias to follow3 but changed the
constr. instead. 147 and 152 vitrum: 602 Qualia sura vitrei, species

here and in what follows his theory involves him in enormous difficulties,
some of which he gets over successfully3 but hardly the present one.
Glass he says lets every image pass: but mirrors, viz. of metaL· do not
let them even penetrate the surface, but send them back at once. And
yet a little quicksilver would have made the glass hurl them back better
even than the brightest polished meta13 and surely he must have seen
sometimes imperfect images sent back from glass. 152 neq. aut. recurs
