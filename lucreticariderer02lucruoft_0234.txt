Scipiadae: all these passages might have reference to a lost one of Ennius
or other old poet, and it is natural enough that both the elder and
younger Africanus should be termed thunderbolts of war; but then Cic.
pro Balbo 34 says cum (luo fulmina nostri imperii subito in Hispania Cn.
et P. Scipiones extincti occidissent. Gnaeus and Publiuswere great generals ;
but still when they met so disastrous an end, it is strange that Cicero
should call them the two thunderbolts of the empire. When we think of
the words scipio and scapus, and the English slzaft, and σκίπων σκᾶπτον
σκῆπτρον, and then σκηπτός σκήπτω and cognate words, and their con-
nexion with the thunderbolt‚ we might be tempted to think that the
Scipios loved to refer their name to it rather than to the more homely
staff. Ι find but one recorded coin of the family, and it has on the
reverse a Jupiter with thunderbolt in the right and sceptre in the left
hand; which might recall both meanings of the word. A parallel case
would be the device of the Sibyl's head on the coins of the Cornelii
Sullae, which was connected with the false derivation of their name from
Sibulla, mentioned by Macrob. sat. 1 17 27. Valerius Max. 111 5 1 has
this remarkable expression in relating the degeneracy of Scipio's son, dii
boni, quas tenebras e quo ficlmiue nasci passi estis s—-I now find that
Fick, vergl. XVoerterb. p. 202, connects all these Latin and Greek words
with many Sanscrit words, and derives them from a root skap, slcvap,
(skip, skzvip), ‘to throw, hurl, set down heavily, press upon'. Goerch.

compared the many words ending in r which have lost the final us, as
