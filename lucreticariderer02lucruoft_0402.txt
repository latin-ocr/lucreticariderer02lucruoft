comp. v 1223 Corripiimt membra3 and lv 83. coactans, as 1122 : coac-
tans 005 corrip.‚ dissoluebat et fatigabat eos, vel ante defessos. 1163
and 1170 posses: see n. to 1 327 possis 3 and comp. the use of crederes
and the like. 1167 ut est cet: ‘ut est sacer igniS‚ dum per membra
diditur' Lach. sacer iynis : see n. to 660: comp. Virg. geor. 111 566 and
Sen. Oed. 187. 1172 partim =nonnu1li3 see n. to v 1143: 1211
partim = 1210 nonnulli. 1175 ipso means straight with mouth, with
mouth rather than or before any other part: comp. Livy XXI 58 3 vento
iniectus imber cum ferretur in ipsa ora 3 XXII 46 9 pulvere in ipsa ora
volvendo ; comp. too Lucr. himself 1v 651 in ore ipsoque palato, 1044
and vl 1207 partis yenitalis corporis ipsas. 1176 Ι nseclabiliter appears
not to be found elsewhere: adverbs of this form seem to have been com-
mon in popular language: the scribblings on the walls of Pompeii shew
not only amabiliter, but also fratrabiliter incurabiliter irrumabiliter
festz'nabiliter and one in n. 2138. sitis, mersans: a bold but expres-
sive metaphor: thirst so drenches the body, that no after drenching of
water can overcome it: comp. Stat. Achill. 1 303 totisque ‘novum bibit os-
sibus ionem. As A and Niccoli have mersans and the Vienna fragment
has messam, the inerrans of B is plainly a mere clerical error, and will

not do to build conjectures upon. 1177 ἐν τῷ ὁμοίῳ καθειστήκει τό τε
πλέον καὶ ἔλασσον πότον. 1179 mussabat: another fine metaphor,

muttering under breath, as not knowing what to prescribe and therefore
not daring to speak out3 500 Conington geor. 111 550: Pliny epist. VII 1
5, being ill of fever, says ‘cum mussantes medicos repente vidissem';
from which use Lucr. may have taken his metaphor: 500 Nonius and
Donatus cited by &Vagner aulul. 131. 1180 patentia, ardentia,
erpertia: see notes 1 and 2 10 v 692 693. ardentia morbis Lumina,
1186 Creber spiritus cet„ 1203 Corruptus sanquis cet: Virg. 1. 1. 504
Sin in processu coepit crudescere morbus, Tum vero ardentes oculi atque
attractus ab alto Spiritus...it naribus ater Sanyuis: this would serve to
defend ardentia, if it needs defence: morbis seems to mean each with his
own disease: but with 1180 1181 comp. Ovid met. VI 246 simul suprema
iacentes Lumina versarunt, animam simul eoelmlarum5 VII 579 Lassaque
versantes supremo lumina motu3 and v 134 Sinyultarctem animam et
versantem lumina vidit: which might seem in favour of Lachmann's
51111110 and possibly true emendation: the peculiar rolling of the eyes
before death is a very marked symptom. This symptom and most of
those which follow down to 1195 are not found in Thuc.: they appear,
most of them at all events, 10 110 derived from the writings of Hippo-
crates which Lucr. must have been well acquainted with3 and not to
have any special reference to this plague: Lucr. indeed seems to forget
for the time that he is describing the gradual progress of a disease in
which some died and others recovered as is told farther 0113 and 10 think
only of drawing a moving picture of the signs of coming death.
