the seventh and the ninth were the two critical days: the sad necessity
of the metre I fear has caused Lucr. thus seriously to vary the state-
ment. 1198 lampade: see n. to V 402 lampada. 1199 fun. leti:

of Thuo3 Galen quoted there by Arnold explains one kind of ἄκρητος
ὑποχώρησις to be the τὸν τῆς μελαίνης χολῆς χύμον unmixed with any
watery matter. 1202—1204 there is nothing in Thuc. correspond-
ing to these vss„ but just before Lucr. has, as we saw, been copying him:
thus 1201 expresses Τ11110.1.1.οἱ πολλοὶ ὕστερον δι’ αὐτὴν οἷσθενεία ἀπεφ-
θειροντο; 1205 foll. he again takes him up, καὶ εἴ τις ἐκ των μεγιστων περιγέ-

τον ἱδρυθὲν κακόν, the disease took its course through the whole body
beginning in the head: is it not then probable that the poet, having a
corrupt copy or an imperfect recollection of his author, has misappre-
hended his meaning, confounding τὸ ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ κακόν with capitis
dolor, and making the whole substance of the body run into the head
instead of letting the disease pass from the head through the whole
b0dy2 1203 sanquis: see 1v 1050. 1204 Huc, ‘in alvum aut
nares' Lach.: I believe it refers only to suares: besides Thuc. says
nothing at all here of the nares, nor is it easy to see why Lucr. should
do so except from misapprehending Thuc. in the way suggested above.

adactus. 1209 fero-0 privs the words of Thuc. which Lucr. represents
111 1206-1211 are these, τῶν γε ἀκρωτηρίων ἀντίληψις αὐτοῦ ἐπεσήμαινε·

through the body from the head downwards ἐς τὴν κοιλίαν, and if a man
was not killed by the terrible ulceration and diarrhoea, it fastened 011
the extremities, the toes fingers genitals3 and some escaped with the
loss of these, στερισκόμενοι τούτων, or of the eyes: Lucr. however has
understood στερισκόμενοι to mean ferro privati, and this has given an
awkward turn to his whole sentence: this misapprehension was pointed
out centuries ago by Victorius var. lect. xxxv 8, and in the letter above
referred to, and seems to have brought upon him no small obloquy, from
Lamb. and his correspondent Mercurialis among others: in those days,
while everybody had ostentatiously to protest against the religion of
Lucr., it 5001115 to have been deemed an impertinence to question his

knowledge of Greek or his clinical and surgical skill. 1211 tamen,
