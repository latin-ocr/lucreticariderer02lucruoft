Aeschylus expresses by γέλασμα, and Aristot. probl. XXIII 1 and 24 by
ἐπιγελᾶν; that is implied in the cachinni and cachinnat of Catullus and
Accius. 9 Placatumque: V1 48 Ventorum ea· ira ut placentur 3 so
Virg. tumida aequora placat and placataque venti Dant maria, the op-
posite of Horace's iratum mare.

10 Nam cet. a poet’s logio: he assumes the sunshine and the
spring to follow on the advent of Venus, because when they do come,
all living things turn to thoughts of love: It ver et Venus et Veneris
praenuntius ante Pennatus 97·aditur. species verna diei i.e. species
veris: comp. 119 Per qentis Italas hominum, and n. to 1 474 3 and
lv 733 Cerbereasque canum facies: it means that aspect of day which
belongs to spring: 1v 137 mundi speciem violare serenam.

11 reserata: the sera being removed from the door of its prison. Ovid
fasti 11 453 et sex reserata diebus Carceris Aeolii ianua lama patet.
yenitabilis used this once by Lucr. and with the active sense in which
yenitalis is so often employed by him. Varro de ling. Lat. v 17 Aetheris
et terrae yenitabile quaerere tempus, which is rightly given to Lucilius
though the mss. assign it to Lucr.: the word is also used actively by
Avienus and Arnobius. VI 805 mactabilis is qui mactati so Virg.

primum: Virg. geor. 11 328 and Ov. fasti 1v 99 and Chaucer at beg. of
Canterbury tales all make the birds first feel the coming of spring ε ‘So
priketh hem nature in hir corages’. 13 perculsae is literally
‘knocked down, struck to the ground’: see Forcellinus and Bentl. to
Hor. epod. 11 2; hence often ‘stunned, smitten through all the frame'
by a strong passion, as here by love, 261 by the rapture of a gratified
craving: comp. Plaut. trin. 242 Nam qui amat, qnod amat, quom
