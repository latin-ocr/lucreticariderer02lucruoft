bant vela theatro: in the theatres at Orange and Pompeii may still be
seen the two rows of stone sockets running along the outside of their
walls on the top, into which the masts fitted that supported the vela or
carbasa3 the trabes I presume were cross—beams which passed from one
malus to another to allow the awning to be unfurled more conveniently.
Pompey's great theatre, the first permanent one built at Rome, appears
to have been finished the year of Lucretius’ death; but the temporary
wooden ones of which he had experience were probably constructed on a
similar plan. Q. Catulus is recorded to have first spread these awnings:
Pliny xlx 23, who calls them carbasina vela. [But see Friedlaender
Sitteng. 11 p. 536; and Archaeological Journal vol. 32 p. 286 (J. H.
Parker), of the Coliseum: ‘it is now clear that there was an awning over
the heads of the spectators in the galleries and kept at the height of 20
feet above their heads by masts on which it was suspended. Those at
the top were known before by the corbels that supported them, and the
holes through the cornice at the top of the building through which the
masts passed. We have now found evidence of similar masts at the
bottom, supported by corbels in front of the podium. It is probable
that the cords which carried the awning were also supported by the
columns on the outer edge of the upper gallery‚ as the distance would
be too long for the cords to bear the weight with no intervening support':
p. 28? ‘we also there (on the upper wall) see the mode of fastening the
masts on the inner side of the wall to hold them fast. '] '77 flutant:

orchestra must have been very marked objects3 and to a spectator,
like Lucu, sitting in the cavea behind them, would have afforded as
much room perhaps for the play of light and colour, as the whole of
the stage. Aen. v 340 Hic totum caveae consessum inqentis et ora
