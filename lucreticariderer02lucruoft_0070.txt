ea· animus imbecillus hilarus inermus are the only forms he uses, 341
mul. mod. mul. a favourite formula of his for the reasons mentioned in
n. to 336. 343 sollicito, an epithet he thrice gives to motus: Virgil
applies it to mare, Ovid to ratis: Lucr. uses the verb more than once in
similar senses. priv. car. seems very tautological: comp. 275 and
293. 345 whereas he assumes the inherent motion of his atoms as the
first requisite for the production of things 346 solidus is his technical
word for what is perfectly solid and impenetrable, that is his first-
beginnings 3 in this sense no res can be solida 3 only apparently so: all
‘res or things in being are rarae, that is have a mixture of void in them.
349 flent: Virgil inlacrimat, Ovid lacrimavit ebur 3 for which Seneca
Thyestes 702 has flevit in templis ebur: but in Lucr. of course there is
no secondary implying of real weeping. 352 totas agrees with arbores
implied in arbzwta which, as is observed at 187, he always uses for the
former: quite similar is VI 188 Quam sint tata maqis quam sursum
extructa, referring to nubibas 3 and on the other hand 215 eas, though
214 nubila caeti is the immediate antecedent, not nubes: 757 quadri-
pedes...th si sint mactata: for which Lach. unskilfully reads fit mactatu'g
and not unlike is 1v 933 aeriis aurisueiua where see note. 355
riyidum seems to personify cold as if it were stiff like frost. 356
qua: 111 498 Qua quasi consuerunt 3 736 qua possint via nulla videtum
Virg. geor. Ι 90 vias et, Spiramenta‚ qua3 Aen. v 590 Mille viis, qua.
358 alias ali is...res rebus: he seeks by the collocation of the words to
increase the force of the antithesis: comp. 816 variis variae res rebus:
876 omnibus omnis Hes. . rebus 3 11 1166 tempora temporibus praesentia
confert Praeteritis, and VI 1085 Ut cava conveniant plenis haec illius illa
Haiusque3 Livy xxxlx 16 4 nunc itti vos sinyuti universos contionantes
timent. 360 ylomere3 but yto‘merari 9Z5merata ytomeramen 3 and
Horace Ut viriosa yto'mus: Lach. gives many other instances of varying
quantity3 thus Lucr. and Plautus coturnices, Ovid and Juvenal cotur-
nices3 Lucr. etc. vietus, Hor. vietis; Lucr. vacillo and vaccilto: see n.
to 11 4523 111 504. 363 inanis is of course the gen. of inane, as 365:
comp. 517 inane rerum which most editors causelessly alter: ‘natura
inanis therefore is like natura (mimi, aquae etc. 367 Dedicat used by
Lucr. three times and always in this sense: comp. indicare: it is synon.
with declarat in 365: Accius 78 te esse Alcmaeonis fratrem facti-s· dedicat.
With these vv. comp. what Theophr. περὶ αῖσθησ. 61 says of Democritus,
βαρὺ μὲν οὖν καὶ κοῦφον τῷ μεγέθει διαιρεῖ Δημόκριτος in his ἄμικτα 01·
atoms. οὔ μὴν ἀλλ’ ἕν γε τοῖς μικτοῖς κουφότερον ἂν εἶναι τό πλέον ἕχον
κενόν, βαρύτερον δὲ τό ἔλαττον, and comp. the de caelo 1v 2. 368 Est
emphatic, ‘exists’.

370—39'7 : some falsely maintain that motion may take place thus:
a fish for example advances, because the water it displaces goes into the
space which it leaves. But without void how can water begin to give
