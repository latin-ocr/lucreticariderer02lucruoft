Sallust, Val. Maximus, Livy ancl the later writers; and Wagner quaest.

Mueller in Jahn's Jahrb. for 1866 p. 393; though it does not seem to

think well in place here. 36 <malet i.e. adire, understood from adit:

marks on this passage) even now in India thousands are killed yearly

uninhabited by reason of this terren] 40 scatit, as vl 891 ; and

Virg. geor. 11 391 saltusque profundi 3 the saltus are the lawns and long
cleliles sweeping down from the hills to the low valleys and plains3 the
silvae represent these more or less covered with wood: nemora and
silvae are often found without distinction of meaning ; but often too, as
here, they are used together, even by Cicero 3 and then Servius to
Aen. 1 310 appears to define them correctly‚ ‘nemus composita multi-
tudo arborum, silva diffusa et inculta': thus Ovid met. 1 568 Est nemus
Haemoniae, pertempta quod undique claudit Silva: vocant Tempe: this
Livy XLIV 6 calls a salcus3 and Eun. ann. 557 joins silvarum saltus:
Livy 1x 2 7 saltus duo alti, anyusti silvosique sunt. Whoever has
come Ἀρκαδίας ἀπὸ δειρᾶν καὶ πολυγνάμπτων μυχῶν, will understand this
v. of Lucr.: the silvae ran up to and covered much of the mayni montes
of Greece and south Italy: 955 and 992 are nearly repetitions of this v.;
