sufficiently shewn this 3 the Ambrosian 111 Plaut. trin. 11 has retained
vocivas, Ter. heaut. 90 the Bembine vocvz'vom3 the new corp. inscr. four
times has vocatio, never vacati03 and an inscription of the age of Augustus
voc-uam: the a does not appear in inscriptions before the age of Domitian:
Manil. 1 13 Hoc sub pace vacat (Gembl. vocat other mss. which means the
same) tantum: Jacob quite mistakes the meaning. 521 and 526 corp.
certa: certus in Lucr. Cicero and the best writers sometimes approaches
in meaning to quidam, and our and the French certain 3 or rather to certus
quidam: corp. certa herezprecisely 675 certissima corpora quaedam:
comp. also 812 alimur nos Certis ab rebus, certis aliae atque aliae res;.
and VI 783 Arboribus certis. 523 the omne or omne quod est consists
of spatium or omne quod est spatium and corpora in its widest sense, as
shewn at length later in this book: see n. to 958: Wak. and others by
placing the comma after spatium utterly pervert the argument. 525
naviter is found in Cicero, Terence, Horace: Lucr. has also duriter, twice
Zarquer, often uniter and lonqiter: adverbs in -iter are very common in
the older writers. omne or omne quod est is nomin. to enatat. 529
so 11 539 penitus penetrari ; and VI 698. retexi: so 243 contemtum for
their structure: one cannot tell whether reteri is gov. of possunt or
queunt: Lachmann’s punctuation assumes the latter. 530 temptata
labare: 537 temptata labascit 3 11 967 dolore Temptari3 v 345 cum res
tantis morbis tantisque periclis Temptarentur: temptare is a proper term
for being assailed by disease. 531 supra paulo: he must refer to 485
foll„ though it seems merely a part of the present argument. 532
conlidi..finnyizdissolvi extrinsecus icta: findi sec.= penetrata reteoei:
534 535 are exs. of 530. 533 nec findi in bina secando, the expres-
sion which comes nearest to the technical Greek name ἅτομα or ἄτομοι, a
litera] rendering of which Lucr. with poetical tact always avoids. 534
manabile, a word formed by him to express what 494 he called penetrale:
mamare is a favourite word of his in similar senses. 536 Lucr. always
says quo mayz‘s or quanto 'maglis or, as once vl 460, quam quoque maqis,
——tam mayis: never quam m.‚ tam m. 543 supra: 149 foll. 546
supremo tempore recurs 111 579. 54¹7 reparandis: this verb is often
used by him in this poetical sense, to produce anew 3 as 550. With the
above section may well be compared the words of Epicurus himself l. l.
41 ταῦτα δ’ ἐστὶν ἄτομα καὶ ἀμετάβλητα, εἴπερ μή μέλλει πάντα εἷς τό μή ὂν

plac. phil. 1 3 p. 877 D gives a good definition of the atoms: Newton
too would seem to have had Lucr. in mind when near the end of his
optics, ed. Horsley lv 260, he wrote ‘it seems probable to me that God
in the beginning formed matter in solid massy hard impenetrable move-
able particles‚ of such sizes and figures and with such other properties
and in such proportion to space, as most conduced to the end for which
