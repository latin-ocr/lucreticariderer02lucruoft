irresistible attraction : such repetitions of res are common in Cicero and
Caesar. [Comp. Plaut. Epid. 113 Is est amicus qui in re dubia re iuvat,
ubi rest opus] ratio is nearly as great a favourite as res: 1 128—130 ratio,
ratione, ratione, and in different senses. corpus, corpora too are used
with like frequency : see also note to 87 5, where however the instances
are to our taste more faulty. 814 foll. give his own doctrine so often

several times in the poem, as 197 and 912 foll. : the 24 letters of the
alphabet can form an enormous number of permutations 3 how many
more then these primordia, the different shapes of which are so many
times more numerous than those letters, while the number of atoms of
each shape is infinite, as shewn in the :znd book? Arist. de gen. et corr.

830—8'74: the homoeomeria of Anaxagoras is equally erroneous:
all simple substances he supposes to consist of infinitely small particles of
the same nature as the thing: bone of minute bones, gold of grains of
gold, earth of little earths, and so on: he denies too void and any limit
to the division of things, like those above mentioned: such first—begin-
nings as these cannot resist destruction 3 so that things would return to
nothing. Again, as food increases the body, the parts of the body are
formed of things different in kind : or if you say all food has particles
like the parts of the body contained in it, then meat and drink consist
of particles different in kind: the same dilemma will apply to what grows
out of the earth, to fiame latent in wood, and the like—Thau Lucr. had
much sympathy with Anaxagoras will be seen at 11 991 foll. where he
translates from Euripides and adapts to his own purpose a passage
founded upon Anaxagoras’ system. There were also other points of con-
tact: Anaxagoras held, as did Epicurus, that the sum of matter in the
universe was always the same, and that nothing could pass into nothing.
Though Lucr. 847 foll. tries to shew that Anaxagoras' principles lead to
a different conclusion, he says, frag. 22 Schaub. (17 Schorn), in words
that Epicurus might have adopted, τὸ γίνεσθαι καὶ ἀπόλλυσθαι οὐκ ὀρθῶς
νομίζουσιν οἵ, “Ἐλληνες· οὐδὲν γὰρ χρῆμα γίνεται οὔδ’ ἀπόλλυται, ἀλλ’ ἀπ’
ἐόντων χρημάτων συμμίσγεταί τε καὶ ἀποκρίνεται. The many points of
difference Lucr. himself clearly shews: see also the editor’s note 21 to
