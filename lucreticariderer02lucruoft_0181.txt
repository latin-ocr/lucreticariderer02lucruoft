this poem was published, and they afford many proofs that Cicero was
familiar with its language: it was not his usage to quote the actual

1098 suffire seems to have the sense of ‘to warm' here only: lv 1175 se
suffit odoribus, it has its proper force. 1100 caeli serena is opposed
to the nubibus: the sonitus arises in the nubibus and shakes the caeli
serena at a distance 3 for VI 99 N ee fit enim sonitus caeli de parte serena, and

ever added to it so as to increase all its parts, until it attained its fun
growth : even thus things which you see growing take in more elements
as food than they give forth, until they reach their maturity 3 then they
