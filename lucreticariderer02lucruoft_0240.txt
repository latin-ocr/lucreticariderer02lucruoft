what he said in the similar passage 1 132-135, that it is to free man
from these baseless terrors he undertakes this question: if it had not
been for these fears, οὐκ ἂν προσεδεόμεθα φυσιολογίαςῑ it is, echoes Lucr.,
the naturae species ratioque which alone can free us from them: comp.
too what he says in a similar spirit 111 31 foll. This passage has the
same unfim'shed disjointed appearance that other passages introducing
new suhjects present: much that is said, has been similarly said before,
or will be repeated presently: we have spoken of this above and shall
have to refer to it again in v and vl: it is one of many tokens that the
poem is in an unfinished state. 39 aliquid nostri is emphatic: Prop.

to ruin: comp. too dare pausam=facere pausam, cessare3 dare sonitum,

Lucr. virgil carries this use of dare farther perhaps than Lucr.: Aen.

impetum dare, and after him Tacitus, for imp. facere. When we thus
find dare finem, cuneum, motus, ruinas, discessum etc. with the precise
force of facere finem etc„ one is tempted to look on it as a half-consciens
reminiscence of the do which sut-vives in credo abdo condo subdo and h'as
the same origin as the Greek τίθημι and the Senserit dadliami: see Max
Mueller science of language, 2nd series, p. 224 ‘in Latin it was equally
