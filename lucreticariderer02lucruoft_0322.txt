μὲν τὸ πρὸς ἡμᾶς τηλικοῦτόν ἐστιν ἡλίκον φαίνεται· (τοῦτο καὶ ἐν τῇ ἑνδεκάτῃ
περὶ φύσεως, ίεἰ γάρ’ φησὶ ιτὸ μέγεθος &al τὸ διάστημα ἀποβεβλήκει,
πολλῷ ἂν μᾶλλον τήν χρόαν’)· ἄλλο γσῖρ τούτῳ συμμετρότερον διάστημα,
οὐθέν ἐστι· κατὰ δὲ τὸ κατ’ αὐτὸ ἤτοι μεῖζον τοῦ ὁρωμένου ἢ ἔλαττον μικρῷἢ
τηλικοῦτον ἡλίκον ὁρᾶται· οὕτω γάρ καὶ ταῖ παρ’ ἡμῖν πύρα ἐξ ἀποστήμα-
τος θεωρούμενα κατά τήν αἴσθησιν θεωρεῖται. καὶ πᾶν δὲ τὸ εἷς τοῦτο τὸ
μέρος ἔνστημα ῥᾳδίως διαλυθήσεται, ἐάν τις τοῖς ἐναργήμασι προσέχῃ, ὅπερ
ἐν τοῖς περὶ φύσεως βιβλίοις δει’κνυμεν; Lucr. doubtless had before him
the llth book of the περὶ φύσεως which Diogenes quotes in the middle of
this extract, and of which such imperfect fragments are published in the
volum. He1·culan.; the τὴν χρόαν there is the claram speciem certamque
fiyuram of Lucu: Cicero does not lose this opportunity of jeering, as in
the acad. pr. 1182, and de fin. 1 20 sol Democrito magnius videtur, quippe
homini erudito in yeometriaque peryle-tm huic pedalis sortasse ‚· tantum

591 maioris: the -is is common in comparatives: the carmen arvale has
in pleores once, 1'11 plear-is twice: the best mss. of Cicero Virgil and others
give occasionally the same f01·1u; Charisius 1 p. 137 Keil attests maiores}

592—613: the great amount of heat and light proceeding from so
small a sun may be explained in several ways: the sun may be the well·
head to which the light and heat of the whole world flow3 or the air
about it may be of a nature to catch tire; or much unseen fire may exist
in the neighbourhood of the visible sun. 594 riqando: see n. to Π
202. 598 Laryejflnnm seems not to occur elsewhere; there is no
authority for the word in the passage of Pacuvius quoted by Cic. de or.

Accedere: for form see 11 1025; for accus. after it comp. Plaut. Stichus

filo—613 Tyndall quotes what he calls ‘this remarkable passage’ before
his essay on iadiation, F rags. of Science p. 170 ; and in the course of the
essay shews that the sun’s invisible rays far transcend the visible in
heating power3 and that about 98 per cent. of the whole radiation from
our fire consists of invisible rays. 613 it is not clear whether tantum
is ‘only’ or 'so much '.

614—649: it is by no means clear how the sun performs its annual
course, and how the moon in a mouth goes through the same journey:
Democritus may be right who says that the nearer any body is to the
earth, it is carried on less swiftly by the revolution of the heaven5 now
the moon is nearer than the sun, the sun than the signs of the zodiac 3
therefore the moon seems to travel {aster than the sun, the sun than the
