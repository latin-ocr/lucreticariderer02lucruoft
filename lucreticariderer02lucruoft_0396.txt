388 BOOK VI NOTES 11

then the iron is repelled, not attracted, because the stream of particles
from the brass first fills the pores of the iron 3 those from the magnet
follow, and finding the iron already occupied, beat on it and repel it:
other things are not thus repelled like iron for various reasons, gold is
too heavy, wood too porcus, iron is the due mean. 1044 Samothracia
seem to be mentioned by Pliny xxxm 23, a most obscure passage 2
Isidore orig. xlx 32 5 says that the Saniothracian ring is aureus quidem,
secl capitulo ferreo : whether this is meant by Lucr. I cannot say.
1048 Aere interp. cet: Lucr. is here completely mistaken from too hasty
an induction: neither the attractive nor the repulsive power of a magnet
is sensibly affected by the interposition of any body which is not sensibly
magnetical, be it metal glass wood paper or whatever else: nay the mag-
net works equally in a vacuum, the absence or presence of air making
no difference: this by the way overthrows the poet's argument 1022—
1041, where he brings in his favourite air to assist in explaining the
attraction between the loadstone and iron. But if Lucr. has failed in
solving the mystery, no one seems to have succeeded. 1050 Praecepit:
803 uisi aquam praecepimus ante. 1053 fluctu is the same as the
aestus of 1051 1056 and 1059, and theflzcmine of 1064. 1054 respuit
and 1055 resorbet appear to be used in designed contrast. 1056-1064
Ι have Joined with what precedes, as manifestly belonging to the same
argument, the repulsive power of the magnet through aes, and have
ended the paragraph with 1064: comp. 1063 Aeris ubi cet: this is
shewn too by 105? impellere, 1060 inpellier, which imply driving from,
not drawing to: 'the purpose of these lines is plainly this: he has shewn
above why iron is attracted and not other metals 3 if now it is repelled
in the way stated, it might be thought that other substances which can-
not be attracted, would a fortiori be repelled where iron is repelled: this
inference he attempts to obviate in these vss. by asserting that gold is
too heavy, wood too porous. 1057 impellere to push on and so repel.
1058 stant: Lach. p. 85 compares 11 181 and v 199 tanta stat praedita
culpa, where stat Ξ est 3 but here stant seems to have its proper force of
standing still, the opposite of impelli. 1059 cum: see n. to 1 755.
1063 Aeris cet. refers back of course to 1044 foll. and 1048 Aere iuter—
posito cet: Lachmann’s arrangement of the paragraphs quite obscures
this connexion, which some I see have absurdly niisapprehended, corrupt-
ing the text by unmeaning changes. 1064 flumine, as 1053 fluctu.
1065—1089: the fact that only iron is attracted by the loadstone
need not excite wonder: many things can be joined together only by
some one substance, stones and woods and various metals ; then some
liquids will mix, others will not: in all cases of mixture and adhesion
the cavities of one substance must mutually come in contact with and
tit the solid parts of the other, sometimes too the union is like that of
hooks and eyes, as indeed seems to be the case with this stone and iron.
