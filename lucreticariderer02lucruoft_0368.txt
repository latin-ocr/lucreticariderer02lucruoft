are a good example of Lucretius' powers of graphio description.

204—218 z fire of a clear gold colour sometimes darts down to the
earth, because the clouds have in them many atoms of fire, and draw
many from the sun; when therefore they are compressed by the wind,
they emit these seeds of flame without noise or disturbance. 204 Hac

coyens his favourite pleonastical assonance3 followed by expressa which
answers to compressit. 213 fulyere: see n. to 160 F ul9it, and 11 27
sulyet: Lach. to maintain his own consistency in regard to the conjuga-
tion offulqere forces on Lucr. a monstrous inconsistency3 for fulyore can
only mean that the atonis of fire produce the colour of flame by their
own brightness‚ though Lucr. in 11 took such vast pains to prove that
atonis could not have colour or any other secondary quality: the atoms
by their action 182 faciunt nictantiafulyurastammae‚ and 217 faciunt
⁸f'ulyorem 3 so here too faciunt flammae fu lfsere colores, which is the same
thing. 215 eas: see n. to 188.

219—238: the marks left by the thunderbolts themselves prove
them to be of the nature of fire: this fire consists of atoms of extreme
fineness, which nothing is able to stop 3 they are far more powerful than
those of the sun—He now, as we observed at 160, comes to the
fulmina, having discussed first the tonitru or clap, and then the fulywr
or flash: see n. to 160, where this was fully illustrated. 220 ictus,
like vulnera and cognate words, sometimes denotes the result of the
stroke as well as the stroke itself : indeed if the results are lasting, as in
the cases here specified, it is impossible to separate the two meanings.
221 halantis is best taken as the nom. plur.: notae halantes gravis auras

quocumque decidit fulmen, ibi odorem esse sulpuris certum est, qui quia
