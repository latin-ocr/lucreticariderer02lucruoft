principles of versification much resemble his own, could write νέινο ad,
leo et, modo ac 3 his contemporary Catullus ioco atque, ave atque. But
Lucr.‚ had he thus elided once, must surely it may be said have done so
more than once: yet he once and only once, v 849 debere, has a hyper-
metrical verse3 twice and twice only he lengthens a short syll. by the
caesura, 11 27 fulyet auroque, v 1049 sciret animoque ; and twice by
caesura leaves a long vowel long and unelided, 111 374 animae elementa,
vl 755 loci oJ›e; though in five of these six cases Lach. tampers with the
text. It strikes me that Lucr. here meant the tangled sound to recal
the entangling of two incongruous images. ¹742 Ham-escit: 11 477

most incongruous assemblage of things, if they have for the instant
formed into one image. '748 ipsa, as well as the imageS.

749—776: so far as what the mind sees resembles what the eye sees,
their causes must be like: now the lion we see in mind is the same we
see with the eyes, both therefore are seen by images: and thus in sleep
we see, for instance one who is dead, by images coming to the mind ; the
senses and memory being then inactive and not able to detect the ab·
surdity: again images move as we see them in sleep, merely because
some are coming others going every instant, so that they appear to be
the same in different postures. '750 ‘I take quod to be the conjunction:
necessest simili ratione fieri quod videmus (i.e. videre) mente, atque quod
videmus (videre) oculis’ N. P. Howard: clearly the right explanation.

there nor in 434 could he have changed the place of quoniam: he has
here written docui quoniam probably for the pleasanter sound: Ov. trist.
