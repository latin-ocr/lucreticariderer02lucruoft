iynis, an expressive metaphor, though less bold than 1176 sitis amida,
corpora mersans: 896 he uses scatere of the seeds of fire, but they may
be said to be part of the fountain. 905 fieri quoque in iltofonte: he

906—916: to discuss now the magnet, a stone which has the power
of attracting iron, and communicating this power to a series of pieces of
iron. 908 Maqneca: Plato Ion p. 533 D ἐν τῇ λίθῳ ἢν Εὐριπίδης μὲν
Μαγνῆτιν ὠνόμασεν, οἱ δὲ πολλοὶ Ἱ·Ιρακλείαν; What follows is so like Lucr.
that Lamb. thinks he had Plato before him. Plato however seems to
misrepresent Euripides: see Hesych. and Photius s. v. Ἡρακλεία amoc:
ήρακλεία (ἠράκλεια) λίθος was the regular Greek name for the loadstone,
the older Greek writers, as Eurip.‚ usually denoting by μαγνῆτις λίθος
6 quite different stone: see Theophr. π. λίθων 41, Hesych. Photius and
the other lexicographers. 909 M aynetum of Lydia, our extant autho-
rities unanimously declaring that the names come from the Lydian
Magnesia and Heraclea: Sophocles indeed, the oldest of them, calls it
the ‘Lydian stone ', the name usually given to the touchstone : see
Hesych. S. vv. Ἡρακλεία, and Λυδική λίθος σίδηρον τηλόθεν προσηγάγου.

d. alt. Wissensch. 11. p. 5—52‚ who makes it probable that the local
derivations of both the magnet and the Heraclean stone were mere
fictions and that the latter meant originally ‘Hercules' stone ', to denote
its attractive power. Pliny xxxvl 128 names the Thessalian Magnesia
as one of the districts where the loadstone was found 3 so that some
connected the name with it perhaps, [fit ortus: comp. Cic. de leg. 111

mss. and Halm, procreatam Manutius] 916 permananter appears to
be a ἅπαξ λεγόμ. Plato l. l. ὥστ’ ἐνίοτε ὅρμαθὸς μακρὸς πάνυ σιδήρων

917—920: but many points have to be cleared up, before we come
to the actual question. 91¹7 Hoc qenus: comp. id yenus, quod 9677773,
omne glenus. multa cet.: he dwells on the magnet at what appears so
disproportionate 6 length, because the phenomena seem to him to illus-
trate so many of his favourite first principles. The elaborate criticism
in Galen de nat. facult. 1 14 of Epicurus' theory of the magnet‚ extend-
ing over many pages, proves that the latter must have dwelt on the
subject at 63 great length as Lucr. does, and that he explained the phe-
nomena in a similar manner. 919 lon. amb.: 1081 Nec tibi tam Zonyis
