706—-721 : but in the case of the form and colours of things, as well
as smells and tastes, some are suited to one creature, unsuited to another:
thus for example the lion fierce as he is cannot face the cock. ¹706
Iioc refers of course to the argument which ended with 686, that the
particles of a thing which excite taste and smell will often fit one crea-
ture, not another. It is hardly possible then to contest what Lach. says,
that this is another of the passages added by Lucr. and not properly con-
nected with the rest of the poem. ¹710 eaplaudeoztibus must mean>
driving off the night with their noise‚ as an actor is driven off the stage.

the lion, VIII 52 and X 48 3 Aelian four times 3 Plutarch and others refer
to it. Martha, p. 258, says that some one, Cuvier he believes, put a cock
into a lion's den: the lion went up to his bugbear and ate him. '716
inceofodizinc : ‘the idea of throuyli. . ‚is often found with inter in Lucr., as

soc.: all these words seem peculiar to Lucr. 719 illis seems a certain
correction for ilus (unless Lucr. could say ibus as well as ibus): 9 times at
least he has the dat. olli33 once, VI 687, the abl. ab ollis, elsewhere abl.
illis: here on the other hand dat. illis which seems to me to sound better
with penetrantibus than ollis.

722-7482 the mind too receives its impressions from images flying
about on all hands, which however are much finer than those by which
we see: images are of different kinds, some formed spontaneously in the
air, some coming from things or formed from a union of several3 and
thus we see centaurs and the like, though such never existed, from the
chance union for instance of the image of a man and horse 3 the extreme
fineness of such images makes them readily unite, and the wondrous
agility of the mind itself at once receives them.—Lucr. in this and the
following sections battles manfully and ingeniously with the prodigious
difficulties under which the epicurean theories on this question labour.
Cicero's philosophica] writings are full of clever argument and banter
directed against them, sometimes successful, but often captious and
unfair. ¹724 rer. sivi: Plut. de plac. phil. 1v 8 Λεύκιππος, Δημόκρι-
