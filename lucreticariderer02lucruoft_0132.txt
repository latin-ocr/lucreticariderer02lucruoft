111 135 tu cetera percipe dicta, 1v 931 tu fac ‘ne ventis verba profanatam,
VI 920 Quo mayis attentas auris animumque reposco: comp. the above
with auctor ad Heren. 111 1 ‘nunc tufac attentum te praebeas: nos prefi-
cis-ci ad instituta pergemus. It is probable then that the somewhat
magisterial tone in which Lucr. so often addresses Memmius was thought
becoming in a philosophical teacher. 67 inter se stipata has, like so
many other terms we have noted in Lucu, a pregnant meaning, so massed
together as not to admit of separation: 1 345 Undique materies quoniam
stipata quiesset: atoms are not united together, as the parts of each atom
are united in the atom; 1 610 Quae minimis stipata cohaerent partibus
arte. 68 materies is of course here as elsewhere the collective term
for atoms. 69 fluere in this sense of wasting, ebbing away is a
favourite expression of Lucr. omnia becomes the object to subducere
in 70. '71 summa and 75 rerum summa have their proper sense of the
whole sum or universe of things3 but Lucr. illustrates what he means
from what goes on in our world, in haec rerum summa, as is natural; for
what takes place throughout the universe is more or less a repetition of
what happens here. 76 mutua is used as an adv. 5 or 6 times in
Lucr.: v 1100 we have mutua inter se, as here: Virgil uses per mutua:
Lepidus in Cic. ad fam. x 34 says szmzma studia officii mutuo inter nos
certatim constiterunt pro nostra inter nos familiaritate. The sense is that
mortals receive life and in their turn give it to others, and so the chain
of being goes on: comp. 111 964 foll. 77 Ον, met. xv 420 sic tempore

the well-known metaphor of the torch-race: Varro de re rust. 111 16 9 nunc
cursu lampada tibi trado 3 the καθάπερ λαμπάδα τὸν βίον παραδίδοντες
of Plato. [For the torch—race see Wecklein in Hermes vol. 7 p. 437—
452, esp. p. 439—442.]

80—141: first—beginnings, when alone, move ceaselessly through the
infinite void by their own inherent motion or it may be after collision
with another: some of intricate shapes form after collision a close union
and thus help to compose hard bodies ; others rebound to greater dis-
tances, and form softer bodies, some do not unite at all, but continue to
wander through space: the motes in a sunbeam will give some notion of
what is meant: single atoms unite into small bodies, these small bodies
form themselves into somewhat larger ones3 till by little and little they
become visible and are seen to move in the sun, though why they move
is not seen. 80 foll. atoms, as we have seen, have weight as an inhe-
rent property, by which they move down space in straight lines at uni·
form speeds, until they come into collision with others: how that is
possible, will be explained 216 foll. 80 Si: to begin a sentence thus
abruptly with si is in the manner of Lucr.: comp. 1017, 111 170, 406,
