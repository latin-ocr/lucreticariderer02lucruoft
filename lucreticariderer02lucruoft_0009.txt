EXPLAINING AN D ILLUSTRATING THE POEM

J EROME, in his ,additions to the Eusebian chronicle, under ‘ohe year of
Abraham 1923=Olymp. 171 3=U.O. 660 or BC. 94 has bllese words
Titus Lucretius poeta nascitur. postea amatorio poculo in furorem versus
cum aliquot libros per intervalla insaniae conscribsisset quos postea Cicero
emendavit, propria se manu intevfeeit anno aetatis XL1111. Donatus in
his life of Virgil writes thus according to Reifferscheid Suebonii reliq.
p. 55, initia aetatis Cremonae eyit [Veryz'lius] usque ad virilem toycam,
quam xv anno metali suo accepit isdem illis consulibus iterum duo-
bus quibus erat natus, evenitque ut eo ipso die Lucretius poeta decederet.
Lucretius died t-hen on the ides of October UO. 699 in the second
consulship of Pompey and Crassus ; and Jerome has misdated the year
of his birth by three or four years. Schoene’s careful critical edition of
the chronicle, founded on excellent manuscripts, enables us now to
speak with confidence of Jerome⁷s testimony. Two of the best] of them
assign the birth of Lucretius to the year of Abraham 1922 instead of
1923. In either case J erome is wrong by a few years, as in many other
instances, and we have nob the key to explain the error. It appears to
me as certain as such a point, can well bc, that Lucretius was born
in the latter part of Rc. 99, or else in the early months of 98, as
is assumed by Usener in the Rhenish Museum‚ vol. xxu p. 442 and
vol. xxm p. 6783 since in either case he would be in his 44th year on
the ides of October 55, U.C. 099. Now no one who has read what so
many scholars have writtaen on bhe question, Joseph Scaliger, Ritsehl
parergon p. 609—638‚ Mommsen Abh. saeclis. Ges. 11 p. 669—693,
Reifferscheid l. 1. p. 363 —435‚ will doubt that Jcrome's additions to
the chronicle are servilely copied from the lost work of Suetonius de
viris illustribus, nor feel much less confidence that Donatus’ account
comes also from the same source. These are thc sole circumstances
