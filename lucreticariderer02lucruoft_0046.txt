evidently alludes to this and some other passages, 111 37 Et metus ille
foras praeceps Acheruntis ccyendus, 1072 Naturam primum studeat coynos-
cere rerum, and V 1185 quibus id fieret coynoscere causis. Formerly I
thought that perhaps Virgil referred to some ideal philosopher, such as
Eurip. fragm. inc. 101 Dind. paints, ’Όλβιος ὅστις τῆς ἱστορίας ’'Eo-xe
μάθησιν κ.τ.λ. and that Lucretius and the maqni docta dicta Sironis
might have prompted Virgil to think rather 01 Epicurus than of Lucr. him-
self. Conington, who in his first edition says ‘that Virgil clearly refers
specially to Lucretius', in his second seems to come to much the same
conclusion as I had come to. But now, when I compare geor. 11 475—
482, 111 which Virgil expresses his longing to be the poet 01 science, with
490—492 Felix qui cet. 3 and then 483-489, in which he declares that,
11 his genius is unequal to that, he will seek the country and its enjoy-
ments, with 493 494 Fortunatus et ille oet, I feel that by his Felix qui
Virgil does mean a poet-philosopher, who can only be Lueretius. For
see my note at 111 449, where I shew at length how Virgil’s whole
mind, when 110 was writing his second. georgic, must have been saturated
with the poetry 01 Lucretius. Sainte-Beuve in his etude sur Virgile‚
p. 108, observes that Lucretius alone among Latin poets seems to have
been honoured by Virgil ‘comme un vei-itable ancien'. '79 comp.

80—101 think it not sinful thus to spurn religion: nay rather
. it is religion who is the mother of unholy deeds3 such as the sacrifice 01
Iphigenia by her own father. 80 Illud in his rebus, a. prosaic, but
very favourite phrase of Lucr. to denote some special point in the general
question. 80—83 comp. Epic. in Diog. Laert. X 123 α’σεβὴς δ’ οὐχ ὁ

used by him 3 indeptus and iacere indu for inicere once each3 as well as

remains of the latter indu governs the abl. endo the acc. The forms
appear to be epic, not occurring in the fragments 01 Ennius' or other
tragedies: indaudire and indipiscor do occur in Plautus: the latter with
