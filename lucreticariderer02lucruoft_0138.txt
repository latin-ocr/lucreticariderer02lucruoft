130 BOOK II NOTES II

11 843 manere, vl 1274 templa manebant. constare is much oftener
used by Lucr. in this sense. Chrysippus wrote several works περὶ τοῦ
μηδὲν ἐγκλητόν εἶναι μηδὲ μεμπτὸν κοσμῷῑ to him and other stoics Lucr.
plainly refers.

184—215 z you are to know too that nothing naturally mounts up-
wards: flames and the growth of crops and trees are only apparent
exceptions : thus blood from a wound spirts up3 and a log forced down ,
into the water starts up again 3 yet we know these things tend down-
wards by nature : so it is with fiame: observe meteors and the like fall-
ing to the earth3 the rays of the sun tending downwards3 lightnings
flying about and falling to the ground : this is their natural tendency.—
This argument is well and clearly put by Lucu: it is directed against
the stoics: see notes to 1 1083 foll. where the same teachers are refuted3
and the same false instances of fire, crops and trees are cited. 184
Nunc locus est: Virg. geor. 11 177 Nunc locas arvorum inqeniis: est
being omitted, as so often by him compared with Lucr. 187 flam.
corp. a mere periphrasis for fiammae: corpora are not here the prima
corpora. tibi dent fraudem = Cicero’s facere fraudem alicui : see n. to
1v 41. 188 auq. sum. recurs v 681. 191 subsiliunt: Cicero in
setting forth this stoical doctrine, Tusc disp. 1 40, uses the word subvo-
lent. 192 degustant: so he himself, Virgil and Horace apply lambere.
liqna trabesque here and VI 241 are used in their restricted sense: liqna
the rafters let into the trabes or main beams: 196 they are used gene-
rally for any large pieces of timber. 194 Quod yenus or quod yenus
esc, an antique phrase which he and the auct-or ad Herennium often use.
The latter appears always to omit est3 as1 14, 11 19 bis, 20, 45, 49, 111 29,
313 but 11 48 quod qenus ii sunt: this makes Lachmann’s insertion of
it here and elsewhere still more unjustifiable. Here and in the auctor
ad Heren. it means no more than velut 3 asin Lucil. 111 29 Muell.: [see the
instances Mueller, p. 204, quotes from Cicero de inv.] 196 Nonne
‘m'desz Lamb. notices his fondness for this phrase. 198 Derecta': see
n. to vl 823: it has here its literal sense ‘perpendicular' opposed to
obliqua: Caes. bell. Gall. v11 23 trabes derectae...in solo conlocamtwr 3
lv 17 4 non sublicae modo derecte ad perpendiculum. may. υἱ
mul.: Nepos vu 3 3 non sine mayna multorum consensione 3 Lucil.
lib. inc. 118 Muell. multorum maqnis ictibus 200 plus parte :plus
iusta parte, or as he says himself 1v 1231 plus parte aequa3 ie. it
starts farther out than it would be, if left alone: Ovid trist. 111 3 16
plus in nostro pectore parte tenes 3 v 10 30 tecti plus quoque parte tenet 3
fasti 1v 301 plus quam pro parte laborat: in all these places it may
mean plus dimidia parte 3 33 in 1 617 pars 3 and in Germanicus Caesar
Arat. phaen. 588 Bootes In terras abit et noctis plus parte relinquit: he
means clearly more than half of night, though the expression of Aratus
583 is very obscure, πλεῖον δίχα νυκτὸς zoua-⁷75: Cicero 364 translates
