154 BOOK 11 NOTES 11

661—699: in this way sheep horses and cattle, eating the same
grass and drinking from the same river, all keep their distinctive differ-
ences; thus grass and each river must contain most different elements:
nay the parts of the same animal are quite different 3 and are formed
therefore of different elements: then too fuel must contain elements of
fire and flalne and ash3 then many things have divers properties‚ colour
flavour and 5111611 3 and these have all different elements as they enter
things in different ways3 things therefore must be of mixed seed: again
as the same letters are common to different words, so the same elements
may be common to most different things, to men and corn and trees.
661 itaque manifestly refers to Multa modis multis effert: with these
words in their old place it has no meaning: the thread of the argument
dropped at 599 is again resumed, 1.6. the great variety of elements the
earth contains. 662 duellica: so duellum duellatores, perduellis which
always remained 111 1156, Dnelonai is an old inscription, cluonoro (bono-
rum) on the tomb of the Scipios: Lach. quotes from Plautus capt. prol.
bellique duellatores optumi, the u of such words in Plautus being gene-

rally, as here in Lucr., a consonant 3 so Ennius perduellibus. 663
Bucericte: Nonius Charisius Servius all attest the feminine: Lucr. uses
the neut. bucera more than once. sul). teq. caeli: see 1 992. [664

porro, 671 porro, 673 Tum porro, as if the use of the word suggested
unconsciously its repetition. 678 iyitur: see n. to 1 419: it has
the force which it not unfrequently has in the old writers, as Plaut.
miles 772 Quando habebo, iyitur rationem mearum fabricarum dabo, the
participial clause being equivalent to a protasis: see Hand Turs. 111
p. 185. 679 fiyuras, 682 fiyuris and 685 primis fiyuris: see n. to 385:
in these three places the word clearly refers to atoms, but may include
also shapes of atoms3 as it must so far have been ambiguous to Lucr.
680 foll. see Journal of philol. 1v p. 243 244: 111 266 Quod yenus in quovis
mimantum viscere volyo Est odor et quidam color et sapor, seems like a
reference to our passage, confirming my conception of it. 681 Bed-
dita: for the neut. referring to 2 masculines Lach. compares 111 282
ventus et aer Et calor inter se viyeant commixta: 111 559 the neut. is ’
even harsher3 see 11. there: the neut. is the rule when the pree. substan-
tives are masc. and fem. cum od.: see 11. to 404. dona: 1v 1237

Nidor, which specially designates the 5111611 of burnt animal matter and
other greasy substances, is substituted for odor of 681. 683 and
684 fucu3=colorz so 744 nullo circumlita suco, and 1v 84 fucum

common.
