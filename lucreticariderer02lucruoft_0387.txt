in Syria: the effects are quite natural, so that you need not look on them
as the gates of hell. '740 quod Averna cet. : quod has here much the same
force as in IV 885 Id quod providet and the passages quoted in n. there:
‘the explanation of why they are called by the name of Averna is this':
without Averna Lachmann's quo for quod would be very well; with it his
reading is scarcely intelligible. 742 loca venere: the accus after venio,
except in the case of domum or the name of a town, is not common: Aen.

doubt what he and Virgil say of the Avernian lake when it was sur-
rounded by thick wood: see Servius Aen. 111 442. ‘No bones existed
in the valley at the time I visited it, excepting of some birds who in
crossing the valley had been arrested on the wing by the noxious effluvia
as at the lake of Avernus of old' Prof. Daubeny quoted in Murray's
hand-book for south Italy, speaking of what is supposed to be the Amp-
sancti valles: exactly the same is told of some marshes in the Carolinas
surrounded with thick woodS‚ by a traveller Bosc in the early part of this
century. '750 comp. Philostr. Apollon. 11 10, speaking of the ’Ἄορνος

Cicero quoted to v 363. ¹754 Perviqili is the gen. of perviyilium: he
alludes to the famous story told at length by Antigonus of Carystus
quoted by Lamb. and Ovid met. 11 542-565, how the daughters of
Cecrops disobeying the orders of Pallas opened the chest in which the
infant Erichthonius was shut up, how the watchful crow espied them and
flew away and told it to Pallas, who in anger at the bad news expelled it
and all other crows for ever from her acropolis: [see Pliny x 303
Aelian v 83 Apoll. hist. mir. v111.] ‘As to the crow, the explanation
seems to be that these birds, which are sccn in great numbers around
the rocks of the acropolis, seldom rise to the summit' Leake Athens 1
p. 206: at all events no Avernian exhalations are now perecived there.
To what Greek poets Lucr. refers I do not know. [But see Schneider‘s
Callimachus 11 p. 98.] 755 loci ope: see n. to 111 374 animae
