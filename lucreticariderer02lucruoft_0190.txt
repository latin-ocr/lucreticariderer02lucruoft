94-135: well first the mind, canimus or mens, is a part of man,
as much as the foot or head: some deny this and affirm the mind's sense
to be a harmony or certain life-giving state of the body by which we
have sense, though the mind is nowhere: they are quite wrong 3 for often
the body is siek, while the mind is happy3 the mind is wretched, when
the body is well3 just as the foot may be sore, when the head is whole:
again the body is often asleep and without sense, while something in us
is moved by various passions. Next the soul too or anima is in the body
and no mere harmony 3 for often much of the body is taken away,
while life continues 3 and often when a few particles only of heat and air
quit it, life is gone3 so that you see that some elements are more important
for· life than others: this harmony therefore 15 nothing. 94 Primum:
he first shews that the animus 15 a part of the body, being in fact in the
region of the heart: 566 140 foll: then 117 foll. he proves the anima
also to be a part, being in fact spread over the whole body: see 143 foll.

more or less disguised in the mss. in 1 1114 and v 38 sei, v 201 avidei,

middle of the word in vi 1217 exciret, 1221 Eoeeibant. ι 100 Grai are
the Greeks who maintain this theory. quod faciat refers to the habitum
vitalem or life-giving or life-supporting ἕξις. Τ116 chief of these Grai was
Aristoxenus a pupil of Aristotle and a famous writer on musicz Cic.
Tusc. 1 19 says Aristoxenus musicus idemque philosophus ipsius corporis
