stabulum, where see note. I do not find Democritus' name elsewhere
attached to this theory: Geminus eleni. astr. 10, though he condemns
it, gives a lucid account of it3 λέγουσι’ τινες, he says3 and he illustrates
it by this comparison: if twelve runners are going round in a circle
at the same pace and a thirteenth is going the same round at a
slower pace, he will appear to be running through those behind him,
while in truth they are all passing him: the sun or the moon is this

conciseness of expression for in partis contrarias iis partibus in quas
superna eunt, and resembles 111 1038 eadem aliis sopitu' quietest and the
like. 649 sidera here, as above 623, means all the heavenly bodies,

650—655: night comes, either because the sun is extinguished, or,
if that is not so, because he passes beneath the earth in the same way as
he passed above it.—In this and the following paragraphs he leaves you
