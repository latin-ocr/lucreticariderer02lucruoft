sub dies festos 5] and sub llaec, sub liaeo dicta, sub lianc vocem, so

canibusque ciere. 547 whoever has travelled over Helicon and

seen and heard its rushing torrents, will feel the fitness of making
them the haunts of swans, and he who has not visited the place, might
well believe that they would come to sing their dirge after having, in
the words of Helicon’s own poet, λοεσσάμενοι τέρενα χρόα Περμησσοῖο”Η
ἵππου κρήνης ἢὈλμειοῦ ζαθέοιοε the reading of course is not certain here
or in 546, where the archetype was injured, as here, in the middle of
the v.; but cucnei torrentib. when some letters were damaged, might
easily get to necti (or nete) tortis.

549—594: as the sounds are coming out, the tongue forms them
into articulate words; every one of which is distinctly heard near at
hand3 but at a greater distance the sound is indistinctly perceived, as it
gets broken in passing through the air: again a single word often strikes
the ears of a whole multitude 3 it must divide therefore into so many
distinct words: often too voices are echoed distinctly back, sometimes
six or seven in answer to one: these the wonder-loving multitude
believes to be the voices and music of nymphs and woodland gods, Pan
and the rest. 550 ‘recto ore: see n. to 11 217 and 226. 551 arti-

ears the form of the word, as the seal impresses its mark on the wax.
