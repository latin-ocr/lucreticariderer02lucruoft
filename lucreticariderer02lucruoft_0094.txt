Terence with the sense of propterea: miles 1158, Amph. 909, eunuch.

account for the condensation and rarefaction of fire. But this course
they preclude themselves from by denying the existence of void. If then
in some other way, which I do not comprehend‚ they believe fire can be
extinguished, then as fire is their sole element, and as it will thus be
annihilated, things will have to be created out of nothing. potesse is
found 11 225 and 1010 ; he also has potis est, potissit, and pote more than
once: see Lach. to v 880, and Fleckeisen krit. Miscellen p. 44-47, who
restores petisset three times in the orations of Cicero. 666 mutareque:
this annexing que to ἔ, which Virgil and Ovid appear wholly ‘to avoid,

Lucr. intending thereby to lay stress on the doctrine involved: see the
passage from Epicurus cited after 689. 670 quodcumque=si quod or
quoties aliquid: then hoe has reference to the whole of this clause, this
passing out of the fixed limits which held the thing in 3 it involves there-
fore the same doctrine as 76 so often repeated, finita potestas denique

when this limit is passed, they die and pass into another condition. The
expression much resembles that of Epicharmus quoted by Diog'- Laert.

quit, quicquit, aliut are not unfrequently met with in our mss: in A
oftener than B, once or twice in both: thet has naturally been retained
where no ambiguity is occasioned, such as by at, quot for ad, quod.

683 omnimodis often used by Lucr. as an adv. :omnibus modis: multimodis
too is used by Terence and himzmultis modis: Cic. orator 153 saepe bre-
