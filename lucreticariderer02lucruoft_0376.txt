because the small particles of cloud are first carried to these by the
wind: then moisture steams up from the sea and rivers 3 and the pres-
sure of the ether above condenses it ; finally many atoms, flying as I
have shewn through space, come into this heaven of ours, and increase
the mass from all sides.-Epio. in Diog. x 99 gives a brief explanation
of clouds, agreeing essentially with this of Lucr. 453 moris, properly
whatever holds or detains, and thence it has the force of nemos: Lach.

495—526: rain comes in this way: many particles of matter rise
with the clouds from all things 3 then the clouds suck up much moisture
from the sea and rivers3 thus the clouds both by their own weight and
the pressure of the wind emit rains3 ancl these are increased by the sun
helping to dissolve the clouds: rains are heavy and lasting, when these
causes combine, and the reeking earth sends its meist-ure back: the rain-
bow comes from the sun shining right upon a mass of cloud. 496 ut
