tempore, not spatio, apparently: see n. to 1 1001: but here it is not
quite certain. 531 protelo: IV 190 Et quasi protelo stimulatur fulqere
fulqur: from the passages 01 Lucilius and others quoted by Forc. the
word appears to denote a number 01 draught-oxen yoked one in front 01
the other and advancing by even successive pulls: hence it well ex-
presses the effect produced by the continuous succession 01 blows 01
atoms. 532 Nam quod cet: an apparent objection to some shapes
having an infinite number 01 atoms, but only apparent: the quool vides
is like the familiar quocl scribis in Cicero, to introduce his own answer or
opinion: see n. to lv 885. 535 numerum: so as to bring it up to an
average: comp. qui seqentorum numerum explebant and similar expressions
so common in Livy. 537 (aequimanus recurs v 1303 as the acc. plur.
seur: Lach. quotes Priscian to shew that centimanus unimanus and the
like are declined like manas and observes that Lucr. is the only writer
01 authority who uses any 01 these words except in the nom. and ace.

uti seems to me not only near the ms. reading, but to give the sense
needed ε were I to assume this further, that the elements were finite, my
argument would be proved by the absurdity 01 the conclusion : euphony
has determined the position of the words, as Quippe etenim hoc quoque

Cic. Arat. frag. XXII Navibus absumptis fluitantia quaerere aplustra.
aplustre, in plur. aplustra or aplustria, was a fan-like erection of planks
rising above the poop : Lucan 111 585 clum puquat ab alta Puppe Tayus
Graiumque audax aplustre retentat. [On aplustra see Mayor to J uv.

adj. pellax: these two appear to be the only good writers who use the
words. 561 aevom: so 111 589 omuem...per aevom 3 Plautus has

proved the question stated 522 10113 the whole paragraph therefore
stands in closest connexion one part with the other. 568 palam
est = apertum est, is found also in Cicero, and Livy XXXI 14 8 and Pliny
