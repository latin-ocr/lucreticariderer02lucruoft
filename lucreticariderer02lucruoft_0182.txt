like everything else must come to its end. 1105 Multaque cet. is a
continuation of the argument broken off at 1089, especially of that con-
tained in 105 8-1063, the intervening vss. 1090-1 104 containing one of
his many impassioned appeals. diemque Primiqenum—coortum is a mere

poetica-l repetition of the preceding words, 1106 Primiqenum is a rare
word, for which lexicons only cite Avienus besides Lucr.: perhaps he
wished to translate the Homeric πρωτόγονος. 1107 corpora and Semina

are of course synonymes. 1110 Appareret: I find no other example
of the use of this verb which is here very expressive: Faber compares
the Greek προσκτᾶσθαι. caeli domus: VI 358 Concutitur caeli domus:
he may have been thinking of Ennius' strange divum domus altisonum
each: Aen. x 1 domus omnipotentis Olympi: but Lucretius' expression
implies more : Hor. od. 11 12 8 Fulqens contremuit domus Saturni veteris.
1111 consurqeret: one can hardly say whether this is simply for surqeret,
or, what is more graphio, for undique circum surqeret, or even suryeret
una cum caelo. This formation of our world is much more fully de-
lineated v 449-508: above, 1058—1063, he described the exordia of
this world 3 here he pictures its completion. 1112 plaqis: these blows
of atoms are, as we have so often seen before, the chief cause of the for-
mation and conservation of things, by enabling the atoms to clash and
try all kinds of union, until some suitable one is found. 1114 umor,
ferra, iynes, aether are used here loosely and poetically for the elements
fitted by their shape etc. to assist in forming water earth eto. 1115

raque aether: for aeraque aer, since the poet here employs Empedocles for
his own purpose, just as 991 foll. he made use of Anaxagoras and Euri-
pides: Emped. 270 πυρὶ δ’ αὐξάνεται πῦρ, Αὔξει δὲ χθὼν μὲν σφέτερον δέ·
μας αἰθέρα δ’ αῖθήρ; in form his vss. are rather a reminiscence of the more
famous 321 Γαίῃ μὲν γὰρ γαῖαν ὀπώπαμεν ὕδατι δ’ ὕδωρ Αἷθέρι δ’ αἰθέρα δῖον,
οἰτοὶρ πυρὶ πῦρ ἀίδηλονι elsewhere too Emped. thus uses αἰθήρ, as 105 Πῦρ
καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ γαῖα καὶ αἰθέρος ἤπιον ὕψος, and 216. Lucr. has probably
only followed Empedocles here 3 but see n. to 1 250 aether, where it is
shewn that he sometimes uses the word strictly, sometimes for the upper
regions generally and the seat of rain: thus in one place he has aetheriae
nubes, in another innubilus aether, in a third aetherias auras. 1116
Donique: this form of donec recurs v 708, 723, 997, always before a
vowel: Lucr. may in one or other place have written doneque, which
in one place, v 708, A pr. m. exhibits. See too Val. Rose in Hermes 11
p. 468, who there and in his edition restores to Vitruvius doneque four
times for the denique of mss, but he does not state the case quite fairly
between donique and doneque, our oldest authority, an inscription, having
as Huebner shews, donique. He quotes however three instances of
doneque from Tischendorf's cod. Palat. of the oldest version of the Gos-
