rationi ratio non estfidem habere. 52 comp. Ciris 46 Accipe dona meo

viqilare serenas. disposta, as 111 420 per-qam disponere carmina: it has
the same sense as diqerere. 54 de sum. cae. rat. as below 127 superis de

the two meanings however easily pass into one another: VI 432 Rumpere
quam coepit nubem, and so inceptum, coeptum.

55 foll. rerum primordia or primordia alone is here declared by Lucr.
to be his proper and distinctive term for the atoms or first elements of
things. Once, lv 28, he resolves it into ordiri prima 3 sometimes he has
instead of it cunctarum eoeordia rerum. In the gen. dat. and abl. where
these words do not suit his verse, he uses principiorum and principiis, in
the plur. only: 707 principium applies to those philosophers who had
only one first-beginning. principia he never employS, thus shewing that
primordia is his proper and distinctive term, and the other a mere sub—
stitute, which he need not therefore here mention: 11 313 primorwm is
used for principiorum. ‘First-beginnings⁷ seems to me to give the pecu-
liar force of the term better than any other word I can hit upon : ἀρχαί,
τῶν ὄντων ἀρχαί and the like are the equivalents in Epicurus and others.
He goes on to enumerate several synonymes: materies i. q. ὕλη, corpora
9enitalia or prima 3 corpora alone or corpora· rerum is more common and
used at least as often as primordia 3 he also has corpora materiai, cor-
puscula too is not uncommon z semina rerum which he mentions here or
semina alone is frequent enough. σώματα, α”τομα σώματα and the like in
Epicurus. Lucr. has no equivalent for αἱ ἄτομοι or ἄτομα σώματα. Cicero
uses corpuscula, atomi, id est individua corpuscula, and individuum as a
subst. to express the atoms of Epicurus or Democritus. Lucr. does not
here mention elementa Which is frequently found in his poem and. an-
swers to one of the commonest Greek words στοιχεῖα. ὄγκοι, bulks or
magnitudes, often occurs in Epicurus, Sextus and others. None of the
above ternis is employed by Lucr. in the sing. to denote one atom except
corpus once or twice: in fact he rarely needs the singular: figurae or
‘shapes’ is not unfrequent with him for his atoms, corresponding in this
sense to the εἶδος and ἰδέα of Democritus, who also has φύσις and the
strange δέν.
