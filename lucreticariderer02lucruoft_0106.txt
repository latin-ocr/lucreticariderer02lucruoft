Anaxagoras much resembles even in language his argument against
Empedocles3 though ,ΑΙ-1310116 from his different point of view is fond
of contrasting the two, 832 patr. serm. eq. : see above p. 11: and n. to
139: these words are quoted by Pliny epist. 1v 18.

834 homoeomerian: the word is not found in the few extant frag-
ments of Anaxagoras, but Lucr. distinctly here states that he did use it 3
as well as Plut. de plac. phil. Ι 3, ὁμοιομερείας αὐτοῖς ἐκάλεσε, and Simpli-
cius to whom we owe so many of the scanty fragments. Lucr. seems to
denote by the term the relation which existed between the things in be-
ing and the particles like in kind, of which they were composed3 ἄπειρα,
63 Anaxagoras says in frag. 1, καὶ πλῆθος καὶ σμικρότητα; these he him-
self names σπέρματα ΟΙ· χρήματα, Aristotle τοὶ ὁμοιομερῆ στοιχεῖα, οἷόρατα
ὁμοιομερῆ, and the like: the later Greeks call them ὁμοιομερεῖαι 111 the
plur. probably from some misconception. Often as Aristotle uses the
adjective, he never employs the substantive, and Lucr. was hitherto the
oldest authority for the latter 3 but now I am glad to say I can trace it
back to Epicurus : see frag. 6 of the 28111 book of the περὶ φύσεως, Gom-
perz Zeitschr. f. Oesterr. Gymn. vol. 18 p. 212, τό γε [στοιχεῖον] ἤδη τὴν
ὁμοιομέρειαν τῷ φαινομένῳ κεκτημένον. Epic. here, as Gomperz explains,
seems to be combating the Timaeus of Plato 3 but he uses it exactly in
the sense I had supposed Lucr. and Anaxag. to have used it, ‘the ele-
ment possessing similarity of parts with the thing in being’. As he and
his school were so well ‹ac-quainted with Anaxagora& I do not doubt that
he got the word from the latter's writings, and that Lucr. had it from
them and from Epic.; though Schleiermacher, Zeller and many other
Germans refuse the term to Anaxagoras himself. 835 foll.. most of
the examples here given are found in Aristotle Simplicius and others, so
that they were doubtless employed by Anaxagoras himself 3 but to shew
the difficulty of knowing in the absence of their writings what these
early philosophers taught, while Lucr. includes, as we might expect, earth
and fire among the simple bodies formed of their ὁμοιομερῆ, Aristotle ·
more than once distinctly states that, while bone, flesh, etc. were simple,
earth and fire were σύνθετα and mixed 666. to Anaxag. in contrast to
Empedocles with whom of course they were elements 3 and again in
metaph. 1 3, unless you are to force his words, as Bonitz does, he flatly
contradicts himself and agrees with Lucr. Again we have no evidence
to shew how Anaxag. supposed these mixed bodies to be formed, and
Lucr. seems in what follows to feel perplexed, or how he conceived
organised things, such as the bodily organs, to be formed, which Arist.
de 66610 111 4, p. 302 b 24, distinctly states he did not form of ὁμοιομερῆ.

twice in Accius, and in Petron. 59. 837 viscus, viscera, occur very often
in Lucr. and always Ι believe denote the whole of the flesh and soft sub-
