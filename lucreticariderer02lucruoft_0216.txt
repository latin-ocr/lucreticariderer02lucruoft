1v 581 locuntur3 590 loquontur3 1018 loquuntur: all these forms pro-
bably, except perhaps the last, were in the mss. of Lucr. within a
generation of his death: a proot' of 1110 excellence of our mss. in their
spelling 3 as none even of Virgil’s retains the old forms in so large a
proportion as this. '715 Haut eric ut possit=haut poterit: 725 est
ut Quaerendum videatur: see n. to 1 62οῑ 011 rhythm of v. see n. to 11
1059. '71¹7 sinceris membris taken as 1110 parts of the 80111 would
agree with 531 Scinditur itque animae hoc quoniam natura nec uno
Tempore sincera ariscio: but I now take sinc. mem. to be ‘from the
untainted body '‚ as Mr Paley suggested 10 1110, 111 contrast to 719 ran-
centi iam viscere: with such use of sine. comp. Virg. geor. lv 285 Insin-
cerus apes tulerit cruor. membris has thus its usual force, 1110 body
opposed 10 the soul: comp. 120; 127; 439 ex hominis membris ablata
recessit ; 772 membris exire senectis 3 010. '721 Exos is also found in
his imitators Serenus Samonicus, and Arnobius [lv 8 si eaeos yenus
humanum velut quidam vermiculi nasceremur} perfluctuat seems
another ἅπαξ- λεγ.; this is imitated by Arnob. v11 17 fervescere vermibus
etfluctuare. 728 ubi sint: so esse in 7893 7913 795 ubi esse et crescere

used here as a subst.: comp. Ν 765 meminisse iacet3 and n. to 1 331:

1v 336 110 1108 corztaqe: comp. v 930 Zabi, and see n. 10 1 978: but 1 806
we find also ut tabe nimborum. '736 Cum subeant, and v 62 Sed
simulacra solere in somnis fallere mentem, Cernere cum videamur ewm
quem vita reliquit, and 680 Crescere itemque dies licet et tabescere noctes,
Et minui luces, cum sumant auqmina noctes, as well as Cato de re rust.
90 cumfar insipient, puriter facito: in these cases cum with the pres. subj.
or potent. seems 10 denote repetition ; as cum seems clearly to be tempo-
ral in them all. Lach. says ‘recte cum subeant: cum res 110 comparata
811 ut subeant corpus, esto iis sane utile sibi tum facere corpus': this
10 1110 explains nothing: J nv, XI 177 all the best mss. have Omnia cum
faciant, hilares nitidique vocantur. '738 utqui: see n. to 1 755.

parents, unless 1110 11111101 like the body comes from a fixed seed‘l if 1110
80111 18 immortal and passes into different bodies, why do not dogs and
“ stags, hawks and (loves, 111011 01101 beasts exchange dispositions‘l they say
the immortal 80111 changes with 1110 change of body: false3 for what
changes is broken up, and therefore dies z if it be urged, a human 80111
always passes into a human body, a horse’s into 0 horse, why then is 1101
