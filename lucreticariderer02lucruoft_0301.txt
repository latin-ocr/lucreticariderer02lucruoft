misses, as well as what he next says, that their abodes are as fine as their
bodies, their existence as he argues in 1161 foll. is known to us only by
the images they send to the minds of men: these images must be much
finer than the bodies of the gods which emit them: are these images
immortal? if not, why are these goda which are much finer than men
and much grosser than their own images, imperishable‘l a dilemma
surely, as they must be intermediate between things alike pei-ishable:
these intermundia too, as shewn in n. to 111 18, are as numerous as the
worlds in space, that is to say are innumerable: why are they all im-
perishable, while numberless worlds are hourly perishing? why do ‘some
rambling troops of atonis upon the (lissolution of a neighbouring world ’,

to use Bentley's words 1. 1., 110νο1· come in contact with them? if by their ’

fineness they elude destruction in this or that place through countless
ages, can they do so in countless different places through countless ages?
but there is no end to such questions: see the last chapters of Cic. de
nat. deor. 1.—In Philodemus περὶ εὐσεβείας, we find between tab. 105
and 123 many tantalising fragments which if perfect would doubtless
throw much light on the nature of the epicurean gods: thus tab. 121,
after stating that all σώματα are τσῖ μὲν συνκρίσεις, τὰ δ’ ἐξ ὦν αἱ συν-
κρίσεις πεπόηνται, exactly as do Lucr. in 1 483 and Epicurus there
quoted, he goes 011 μήτε γὰρ οἶτόμους νομίζειν τοῦς θεοὺς μήτε συγκρίσεις
(συνθέτους-2), and 122 ἅπασαν τήν σύνκρισιν φθαρτήν. Probably therefore
they attempted in regard to their gods to explain the inexplicable some-
what for instance as Lucr. 1 59 9-634 comments on the parts of an atom,
or 11 216—293 on the minimum of declination: the gods were not συγ-
κρίσεις, but quasi σνγκρίσειςε their atoms had not come together so as
again to be separated3 but were in eterna] juxta—position, etc. etc.
