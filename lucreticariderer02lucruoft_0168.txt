here join licet and possis: comp. too Ovid rem. 415 Dum piqet et malis
nullam tetiyisse puellam Tacturusque tibi non videare diu: but comp.
too ars 111 761 Aptius est deceatque mayis. inolentis another ἅπαξ
λεγόμ. 851 auram: Martial 111 65 2 de Corycio quae venit awra
croco3 and Virg. geor. 1v 417 spiravit crinibus aura. 853 viro in
this sense is almost unexampled: VI 805 odor viri is used for the pungent
fumes of charcoal. [Mart. VI 93 7 Virus ut ltoc alio fallax permutet
odore 3 1 87 5 Quid quod olet yravius mimum diapasmate virus ?]
859 Cetera without et: so 1085: it is found in Cicero, as topica 27.
tamen, as so often, implies something understood: all these, whatever
they are, however much they differ, are yet of such sort as to be liable
to death, whether they are Molli lenta or etc. : the molli lenta seems to
refer to fire and heat, fraqosa putri to ice and co1d‚ cava corp. ‘raro to
flavour sound smell 3 as they are all material and would seem, where he
describes them, to be of bodies severally like these: Cic. ad Att. 1v 15 2
cum illis tamen, (i.e. even if you desert them now), cum salvi venerint,
Romae vivere licebit. 860 fiwsyosa :fragilia : a sense which the word
seems nowhere else to bear. 862 subiunycre appears to be the op-
posite of seiuncta in the preceding verse: such things must be detwhed,
that imperishable foundations may be attached to things.

865-885: all things which have sense come from insensible ele·
ments: a visible proof of this you may see in living worms rising from
the putrid earth: again grass ancl water change into cattle, the flesh of
cattle into men, men often go to feed beasts ancl birds: nature turns food
into what has life and sense, much as clry wood passes into fiame; so
much is effected by transposition and mixture and motions of elements.
—That the soul, the vital principle and sense were born and died with
the body in all creatures, was of course a necessary doctrine of the epi-
cureans and is passionately asserted by Lucr. throughout the third book.
866-870 and 888 insensilibus: this word as well as sensilis seems pecu·
liar to Lucr. among writers of authority: Arnobius his constant imitator
has insensilia. 869 ipsa manu ducunt: Aen. 111 372 Ipse manu multo
suspensum numine (lacit, literally: the met-aphor is obvious: χειραγωγεῖν

important from his point of view, he often repeat33 see 898, 928, 111 719,
v 797 : Aristotle and the old physiologists seem to accept it as an un-
doubted fact. 872 putorem: 929 putor, Vl 1101 putorem: all of the
rottenness of the earth after rain 3 though putor in Varro de ling. Lat. V
25 and elsewhere is said of a putidus odor: Lamb. and others would read
in all these cases pum-or. 874 itidern i.e. inanimate things into living
and sensible. 875 comp. 596 Unde ctiam fluvios frondes et pabula
laeta cet.: this justifies Lambinus' correction: the streams, the leaves
and grass seed and sustain beasts, beasts feed us. 878 pennipotentum:
this expressive word recurs v 789. 881 flame seeming to be no more
