suboles lascivi yreqis i.e. a kid; for lascivus yreae cannot mean anything
but the young kids; Apul. met. x 32 innuptarum puellarum decorae
suboles: in no other way can Ι understand sanquis meus, yenus deorum,
deum qens and the like, than as meaning belonging to my blood, one of
the race of gods etc.; Aen. x 228 <leam qens, Aenea seems synon. with
VIII 36 sate yeute deum: so too I understand VI 792 divi qenus compared
with divum yenus 3 and Lucr. 1 42 Memmi propaqo compared with lv 998
catulorum propayo. oriyo has here the meaning of partus or birth:
perhaps mul. or. is literally the beginning of a woman.

1233-12'77: it is not the gods who grant or withhold offspring: con-

ception depends on the due assortment of man and wife. 1233 cui-
quam Absterrent: see n. to 1064. 1236 Quod cet.: vl 1015 Quod
facit et sequitur. 1237 adolent: Aen. v 54 strueremque suis altaria

donis, xl 50 cumulatque altaria doni-s being compared, this ambiguous
word would seem to have the sense here of causing to grow, increasing,
and so piling up: Virg. geor. 1v 379 Panchaeis adolescunt iynibus atrae,
adolescunt seems to be its neut.‚ ‘grow' or ‘are piled up’3 but in Lucr.
‘cause to smell ' or ‘burn’ would give a suitable sense ; see Conington
to Virg. ecl. vm 66. The notion of increase would appear to be the
most natural, if the word had come to be merely one of good omen and
conveyed only a conventional meaning to a Latin ear; as it would seem
to have done to Tacitus, who in ann. Χιν 30 has cruore captivo adolere
aras3 in v1 28 subire patrium corpus inque solis aram perferre atque
adolere. However Ov. met. 1 492 adolentur=si1nply uruntur. 1239
sortis: Juv. 1 82 sortesque- poposcit: Cic. de div. 11 86 says hoc quidem
qenus divinationis vita iam communis explosit. fani pulchritudo et vetus-
tas Praenestinarum etiam nuuc retinet sortium nomen, atque id in volqus:
these Praenesti nae sortes he describes l. l. 85 as in robore insculptas pris-
carum litterarum notis: Ritschl Rhein. mus. n. f. xlv p. 389 foll. amends
and explains some very singular old hexameters, containing a. series of
sortes, such as these must have been. fatiyant: 11 1172 caelumque fati-
qat. 1242 locis aelf? adh. seems not unlike Aen. 11 536 Et flammam
adfixit lateri 3 [Plaut. Amph. 853 Huc...adventum adporto] 1244
his i.e. aliis, with reference to 1240 partim. 1246 penetratum, be-
cause peuetro and penetro me in are equally in use. .125o Suo-
cipiunt: v 402 succepit A: Ribbeck admits this form four times
into the Aeneid with more or less ms. authority 3 and Servius thrice
rcpeats that succipio is the old form. ingravescunt seems not to occur

elsewhere in the sense of becoming big with child. 1252 unde i.e.
eas ex quibus. puellos: Nonius p. 158 quotes this v, and Ennius
Lucilius and Varro for this form. 1254 fecundae: the wife may be

able to bear and the man to beget 3 but they may not suit one another ;
though in another marriage the man may have children. 1259 liqui-
dis et liquida3 see n. to 11 452: the juxta-position here seems almost as
