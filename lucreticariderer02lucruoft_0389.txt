θόντας ὅταν ὀργᾷ μάλιστα πρὸς τὴν ἅνθησιν; Dicaearchus frag. 60 in
Mueller frag. hist. Graec. 11 p. 261 tells the same of a plant on Pelion,
τοὺς δ’ ἁψαμένους αὐτῆς ἀναιρεῖ τῇ ὀσμῇ. ’789 Multa cet„ 790 Quod :
Lucr. seeks emphasis by placing many words before the introductory con-
junction3 as V 440 Propter dissimilis formas variasque fiyuras Quod non
omnia cet. 3 1 751 quae cernere non quis Eaelremum quod habent: so with
the relative, as 1 557 lonya diei Infinita aetas anteacti temporis omnis
Quodfreyisset 3 IV 607 3 VI 980: and so lv 430 Tecta solo iunyens atque
omnia deoetera laevis Donec >in obscurum cet. '793 describes one labour-
ing under epilepsy or morbus comitialis3 comp. 111 487 f011.: Lachmann's
treatment of this v. is quite preposterous 3 some diseased condition is
clearly required, as a healthy person is not acted upon in the way stated.
795 man. effl.: Ovid met. 111 39 Effluxere urnae manibus. '796 si
od.: see n. to 11 404. '797 per arcus here is simply per totum corpus,
or membra per artus: onmia membra3 see also n. to 11 271. ‘799
lavabris is to labris, as lavatrina to latrina. 800 solio, which properly
means the seat in the bath on which the bather sat, here, as often, seems
to denote the whole basin which held the hot water. But in Lucretius'
time it was prob. only a tub or pan for a single bather3 as Celsus vl 26
5 in solium is aquae calidae resupinus demittendus est 3 1 4 in solium non
descendere. solium seems synon. with lavabrum 3 though in later times
the solium became a large piscina holding many bathers at once. Yet
solium may be the piscina here3 comp. Petron. sat. 92 circa solium scolen-
tibus. 804 membra domus: Gronov. obs. 111 5 p. 467 quotes Cic. ad
Q. frat. 111 1 1 nec habere poterat adiuncta cubicula et eiusmodi membra,
and Pliny epist. 11 17 9 dormitorium membrum: comp. also v 6 15 multa
in hac membra; atrium etiam ex more veterum Apul. met. 111 28 sinyula
domus membra cinyil armata factio. But as said in notes 1, the reading
is very very uncertain: I doubt whether I am right even in adopting viri
for vini 3 for Lach. is certainly wrong in saying that At proves he has not
passed to a new question: Lucr. like Cicero often uses at to introduce a
fresh illustration 3 see the many instances given in n. to 1V 414 At con-
lectus: comp. too Hor. sat. 11 4 51 Massica si caelo suppones vina sereno
...decedet odor nervis inimicus, which will support nervis, perhaps vinias
well. 805 mactabilis is another ἅπαξ λεγόμ.; Lach. compares Accius
421 leto labzficabili. 810 Scaptensula is the σκαπτῆ ὕλη of Macedo-
nian Thrace: Lach. explains the strange Latin form with much proba-
bility: the s he supposes to be like the s in silva, and to represent an
older form of the Greek ὕλη, always retained by the inhabitants of the
place 3 the n then in Latin merely marks the lengthened vowel, as in
thensaurus Termensz'um and the like: comp. too totiens toties, vicensimus
vicesimus, and the numerous instances in which the Greeks express the
Latin -ens by -ης, shewing the pronunciation of the former: Lach. then
