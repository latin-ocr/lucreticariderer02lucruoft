the breaking up of the whole inner structure of a thing by some greater
force, esp. heat as here: 1v 697 iqui conlabes'acta3 Aen. vl11 390 Intravit
calor et labefacta per ossa cucurrit. riqor: Virg. geor. Ι 143 Tum ferri
φόρον 3 Manil. 11 7 80 ferrique ri90r3 Prudent. perist. x 702 aeris autfhrri
φέρον. 493 ylacies, a bold but expressive metaphor to which I know
no exact parallel3 but Mart. 1 49 12 says ,Salona quiferrum yelat.

494 penetrale: Virg. geor. 1 93 [and Mart. lv 19 9] penetrabile friyus.

496 lymph. rore: 771 roremque Ziquoris3 777 cum rore 3 1v 438 rorem
salis. 499 ades: adesse animo and animis are common in Cicero:
but as here, Ov. ex Ponto 111 3 2 acles, Dum tibi quae vidi refero 3 Plaut.
Men. 643 audiatque ades 3 merc. 568 ausculta atque cide33 Sen. Hipp.
1175 Ades parumper.

503—550: where void is, body is not: these first bodies therefore
are solid and without void: things in being all contain pure void
enclosed by pure body: these first bodies then may continue, when
the things are broken up: and void we have shewn must exist3 it
alternates then with body: these first bodies cannot be crushed split or
broken up from within 3 they are therefore etei-nal: without this eternal
matter all things would have come from nothing, and would have been
reduced to nothing: first-beginnings therefore are of solid singleness.

506 sibi appears to be added merely to increase the force of per se and
puram as in English we say ‘in and for itself', ‘for and by itself': 111
145 quue sibi solum per se sapit 3 684 per se sibi vivere solam ε per se is
often used by Lucr. with this force: we have already had it eight times.
This being a cardinal point in Epicurus' philosophy, the absolute dis-
tinctness of the atoms and void which alternate in everything in being,
he puts the statement of this doctrine in a variety of shapes. The
necessary result is the absolute hardness and impenetrability of his first-
beginnings, and it is the absence of this perfect fulness and solidity
in the elements of rival philosophers that he again and again most
strongly inveighs against. 507—509 quacumque, ea: Livy XXIV 2 10
quacumque, ea3 and qua, ea again and again. 508 tenet se :locum
tenet, and tenet neut.: in Livy intra Appeninum, loco, finibus, castris,
muris, ‘moenibus se tenere and the like are very common. 511 qenitis
in rebus, to express more distinctly what in rebus alone expresses.

515 solidum in its technical sense of perfect impenetrability: see 11. to
1018 mayuum, and 1v 63 tenuis. relinquas: this verb in the sense of
conceding occurs not unfrequently in Lucr. as soon after, 658 and 743:
for the infin. see 11. to 111 40. 517 as inane is so oft. a subst. in Lucu,
surely in. rer. for ‘the void of things in being’ is not harsher than 363
natura inanis (gen.) and 365 plus esse...inanis. 520 vocaret: with
the old writers voco, vocuus, vocatio etc. were the common, if not the
only forms in use for vaco, etc: Fleckeisen, Bergk, Buecheler Rhen.
