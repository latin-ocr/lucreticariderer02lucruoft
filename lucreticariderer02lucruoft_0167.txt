smell.

842—864: but atoms are lik'ewise without heat or cold‚ without
sound flavour or smell. As in preparing a perfume you seek out a quite
scentless oil, that it may not infect the perfume with its own scent 3 thus
first—beginnings must possess neither heat nor cold, smell sound nor
flavour 3 these qualities are all frail and mortal, and must therefore be
wanting to immortal elements unless things are to pass away to nothing.
842 colore: the frequency with which this word has been repeated in the
last 100 111103 13 very striking. 842 1011. notice the variety 01 expres-

in Sextus adv. math. VII 135 said νόμῳ γλυκύ καὶ νόμῳ πικρόν, νόμῳ θερ-

esse, 845 ferunturzsunt, as cluent so often is in Lucr.: it is curicus
that two such opposite words should come to have the same force : ferun-
tur is elsewhere applied by him to his atoms in onward motion 3 but that
can hardly be its sense here: with manere comp. VI 1274 and the use 01

calidum tepidumque vaporem, the epithets are distinctive. 845 sonitu
sterila: the gen. is more common: the form sterilus is mentioned by
Festus: see n. to 1 340. suco ieiuna: Cic. orator 106 has the gen,

argument is the mixture with oil. 848 nardi florem, unless Lucr. is
speaking vaguely‚ must be used, as Bacchi flos and the like, for the
aroma or bouquet 3 as it appears from Pliny and Dioscorides that it was
the ear and leaf 01 the eastern nardus that was used in perfumes3 the
stalk and root 01 the northern. 849 Cum...iustituas: see n. to 41.
