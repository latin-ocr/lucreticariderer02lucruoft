it, and perhaps Cicero means loquebamur to contrast with scribebamus.
Lucretius' frequent einployment of this archaism‚ after it had been gene-
rally dropt, may be one of the reasons which made Cicero deny him asrs, if
indeed he did deny it him: see introduction p. 17 foll. 187 probably
he meant the rhythm to be an echo of the sense. arbusta: as arbores
cannot come into the verse, Lucr. always uses for it arbusta in the nom.
and acc: but as arboribus is suitable enough and often used, in the only
instance of arbustis, v 1378, the word has its ordinary meaning of plan-
tations of trees. 188 quando in the sense of quoniam or quandoqui-
dem and always governing an indic. is oftener employed by Lucretius
than in the temporal sense ; and is common in the older writers: Madv.

hiatus here such as I have suggested I feel certain, and I believe I have
given almost the words of the author: comp. too 180 Quod si cle ‘nilo
fierent, subito emorerentur, Incerto spatio atque alienis partibus anni:
where the opposite is stated, paulatim contrasting with subito, tempore

also Ιι. ac. item quod. 197 he several times repeats this comparison
of the elements of words with the elements of things, lecl to it doubt-
less by the common name. It is a favourite and natural artifice of his
to give colour to his arguments on abstruse matters by illustrations from
things visible or intelligible to all: to this we shall often have occa-

its ordinary sense3 the other two being 111 948 and 1090 : see n. to 20
saecla: so that vit. saecla will here mean the number of years over which
a life, probably a human life, extends: comp. Virgil's imitation in geor.

the phrase. 207 Aeris...auras and aeriae aurae are very favourite
pleonasms for aer in Lucr. teneras: 11 146 Aera per tenerum: the air
has the same epithet in Ennius Virgil and Ovid: it implies what is soft
