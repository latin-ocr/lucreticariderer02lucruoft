is no other certain example of the word in Lucr. as v 1013 Conubium is
introduced by conjecture: many and recently Luc. Mueller de re metr.
p. 258 argue for the two quantities of the word: the latter says ‘nota-
bile quidem debuit videri tot exempla durissimae synizesis cur noluerint

cum alibi non plus septiens admiserit, in uno vocabulo conubii, si pro-
ductam habet semper secundam, deciens octiens eam adhibuisse erit
credendus’: he further shews that the old grammarians Consentius and
Servius hold it to be short in such cases Conington to Aen. 1 73
observes ‘the analogy of pronubus innnbus might be pleaded as proving
a variation of quantity ς but no clear instance of conubium occurs except
in Sidon. Apoll.’: Prudentius also has it short; and Claudian, a far
higher metrical authority than any of the christiam, writes epist. 11 18
Vectiyal meritae conubiale lyrae ; it is quite true that in the time of all
these writers the native feeling for quantity was utterly lost and did not
then exist in the Roman world; it was learnt only from tradition by
Claudian and Servius as much as by Prudentius or us3 but in reply to
Conington’s pertinent remark it might be said that the word is not used
at all by Tibullus and Propertius nor in his lyrics and elegiacs by Catul-
lus, that Ovid has only the form conubia in his elegiacs; that the word
in the singular or dat. and abl. plur. occurring so often as it does in
some writers, in Virgil 8, in Statius 18 times, is always found with the
u in thesis, never once with it in arsis, and that though Lucan who
resolves the ii of the gen. twice uses conubii, Virgil Aen. 1v 167
chooses to say conscius aether Conubiis‚ not Conubii.—But I now have
the conviction that here it is conubia: I have taken mortalis which
would be equivalent to conubjum or conszja, an’d find that Lucr. has
mortalis 23, mortalis 14 times3 it is therefore beyond all reasonable
probability that we never should find in any poet connbjum 3 the more so
that the final syll. might be efided, as Stat. Theb. x 62 Expers conubii et.
But what follows completes I think the demonstration that it is coniz-
bium: here in Lucr. we have Denique conubia ad 3 Stat. silv. 11 3 19

tum crimine patrem] Now that conubja should have only these two
positions in the v„ never once one of the many more convenient ones,
and that the a should always be elided, is more than improbable: take
natura or aeterna in Lucr. and see where they come in the v.: whereas
conubia would naturally form the first foot, as above in Statius,
and could seldom have any place but that or the 2nd foot, as here in
