—periimus (uryuent, instant Muell.)] Yet claustris might be the
modal ab1.: most of the editors seem to take aera for the cardo3 but as
the ancient cardo had nothing in common with the modern hinge,
claustris must then apparently mean the socket of the door-flap which
moved about the aera or pivot of the postis : this it can scarcely do. In
ordinary doors the aera would be the pessuli, one of which went into a
claustrum in the upper limen or lintel, the other into one in the lower.
Hence each door-flap or valva had two, one above one below: Plaut.

shapes meet =qlomeramen iu uuum: from the context qlomeramina would
seem in our passage to mean ylobosa primordia, the round particles of
any liquid 3 but if so, this sense is in strange contradiction to the mean-
ing which Lucr. elsewhere gives to it : if it means the drops into which
a liquid sometimes forms, that would only apply to a few cases in which
a liquid so disperses itself : the words retinentur inter se are ambiguous,
as they may refer either to a composite body keeping together, or to
the separate atoms holding themselves in union. 455 proclive: see
Cic. de fin. v 84 proclivi currit oratio, and Madvig there who shews
that proclivi and proclive are the same in meaning and used adverbially:
he compares facile and sublime, and refers to Gellius X 24 who says the
ancients used proclive and proclivi indifferently: Cic. Tusc. disp. IV 42
