aequore salso: Aen. v 512 notos atque in nubila fugit.

624—633 : again if the 50111 15 immortal and ean exist alone, it must
have the five senses, as imagined by writers and painters3 but none of
the senses ean exist alone away from the body. 626 sens. auctam,
630 sensibus auctas: 1 631 quae nullis sunt partibus aucta 3 Catull. 64
165 quae nullis sensibus auctae. 631 sorsum 1.5. a corpore : comp. 11
910 foll.: Luor. writes indifferently sorsum and seorsum, seorsus and
sorsus, when they are equally dissyllables: seorsum is sometimes too a
trisyllable 3 1v 491 foll. within three or four vss. we have seorsum, seor-
sus and sorsum3 and seorsum both trisyl. and dissyl. 3 v 447 448 sorsum,
Sem-sus. deorsum and dorsum, both found in inscriptions, may be com-
pared: see also n. to 11 202. 633 per se i.e. sine corpore: to sentire
and esse, animae is understood from 632.

634—669 : since life and sense pervade the whole body, if it be cut
in two by a sudden stroke, the soul must also be divided 3 but what is
divided cannot be immortal : a soldier's arni or foot or head cut off in the
heat of battle will shew for a time reinains of sense and motion 3 a
serpent chopped in pieces will writhe and with the severed mouth seek to
reach the other pieces of the body : now you cannot say that in each part
there is an entire soul 3 therefore the 50111 has been divided, and there-
fore 15 as mortal as the body. 639 dissicietur: see n. to 11 951.

qui Ῐιαηο petessunt nullum fiiqiunt dolorem: Festus p. 206 says it is
saepius petere 3 verbs of this form being generally aocounted desiderative.

x 341 Deaetera. . moribunda. 658 utrumque is the Greek ἀμφότερον,
0111· ‘both'‚ as VI 499 utrumque Et nubis et aquam3 where see note:
perhaps minanti may be retained, ‘protruding from': comp. Virgil's
scopulique minantur I n caelum. 660 ancisa seems not to occur else-
where: see Key's Essays p. 9 : he compares it with anquiro and anhelo 3
and the an with οἶνοί. [Comp. Ov. fasti 111 377 Atque ancile vocat, quod
ab omni parte recisum est 3 also Varro l. Lat. vn 43 ancilia dicta ab

ambecisu, quod ea arma ab utraque parte, ut Thracum, incisa] 662
Ipsam se, the mangled body and tail. 663 ardenti, burning with the
torture. 665 at ea oet. which is absurd3 therefore etc.

670—6'78: if the soul is immortal, why cannot we recollect what
happened before our birth? if the mind 15 50 changed as to forget every-
thing, that is very like death3 so that even thus you must admit that
