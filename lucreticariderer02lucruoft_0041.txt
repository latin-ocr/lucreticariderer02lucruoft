struck by the son of our Memmius, one with a head of Ceres, in honour
of his father 3 the other in honour of a remoter ancestor, with a Ceres
and the legend Mmmms· AED· CERIALIA· PREIMUS· FEcrr. At the open-
ing 01 book v Ceres is spoken of and a long enumeration made of the
deeds of Hercules, which are shewn to be far inferior to those of
Epicurus. In the beg. of vi the discovery of corn is recorded, but de-
clared to be of less importance than that of philosophy by Epicurus.
Did Lucr. mean to say ‘You pride yourself, Memmius, on your family
connexion with Hercules and Ceres 3 but let me tell you you had better
learn to be proud of the philosopher'2 Many of these motives may have
weighed with Lucr. and his poetical instinct carried him beyond his first
intention. Let me here refer 130 Prof. Sellar’s Roman poets of the re-
public p. 276 foll.

50—61 he calls on Memmius to attend, while he explains the nature
of the first elements of things. 50 Lach. has rightly seen, as I have
said in notes 1, that the interpolated verses have thrust 0111 1116 protasis
of this sentence, in which Memmius must have been addressed 3 unless
the Verona interpr. Verg. misquotes and refers to 1v 912 tenuis aures
animumque sayacem, which is not probable : the omission of part of the
v. in AB suggests a still greater disturbance. Quod superest is a
favourite expression of Lucr. for ‘to proceed to what remains' ‘more—
over’3 and is often put in the middle of a sentence at the beg. of the
apodosis‚ as here: compare 11 39, 491, vl 1000, etc: see also 11 546 and
lv 195, where it is in another part of the sentence: perhaps Aen. 1x 157
is likewise a case in point. vacuas auris is well illustrated by
