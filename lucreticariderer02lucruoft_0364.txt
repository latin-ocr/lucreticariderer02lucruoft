of b for p in such words is very rare in our oldest authorities 3 thus
the inser. Lat. 1 always has scriptus: the b seems to have become
more common in the silver age, artificially recalled no doubt: the best
mss. of Virgil however have sometimes the b, as geor. 1 200 sublabsa

96—1202 thunder comes from the collision of clouds ; the denser
they are, the deeper the rumbling3 sometimes the noise is like that of a
sheet of canvas blown about, sometimes like the crackling of paper3
sometimes the clouds graze each other sideways and occasion a dry pro-
tracted sound—We again come to matters beyond the certain test of
sense 3 of which therefore many explanations may be and consequently
are equally true: the remarks appended to v 533 will apply here and to
what follows. 99 Nec fit enim 1.0. nec enim, or neque enim fit.
105 Nam cadere aut for nam aut cadere, an idiomatical irregularity such
as all Latin and Greek writers allow themselves, and which cannot be
refused to Lucr.: indeed 11 393 Aut quia cet. is of much the same
character, and v 383 vel cum sol is more violent3 see n. there. bruto:
Paulus Fest. p. 31 ‘brutum antiqui gravem dicebant'. 108 aeq. mum:

else 3 it must mean, to get up and practise a subject, and thus represent
or imitate it. 112—115: the punctuation must be noted: in 112
frayilz's denotes the scraping rasping noise made by tearing papyrus: 111
Virg. 001. vm 83 it denotes the crackling noise of burning laurel; in
Prop. v (iv) 7 12 the rattling made by a skeleton's hands, words denoting
sounds being vague in Latin: sonitus of course is uncertain. Then 114
115 have the appearance of a subsequent addition; for 116 seems to
refer to 113: the kind of thunder resembling the noise of torn paper or
canvaS. As they stand, it seems you must take the constr. to be ‘Aut
ubi. . per auras, id quoque genus cognoscere possis’ 3 unless it be better
to refer the Aut to 109 ‘ut carbasus, aut ut suspensa vestis chartaeque
volantes, ubi eas cet.' so that it would be an instance of that Lucretian
idiom illustrated in n. to 1 15: in 114 que need not be changed to ve:
