testanda vota] 434 this ‚point is put with emphasis to shew the
vast importance of touch3 for as nothing can tanyere et tanyi sine corpore,
so nothing 6611 sine tactu sentire: all the senses 616 but different forms of
touch: 116 then enumerates the different ways in which the body 6611
feel 3 either something enters from without, and gives pleasure or pain3
or something takes place in the body, and gives pleasure or pain3 or
thirdly the atoms in the body itself, before quiescent, are troubled by
some collision and 50 disturb the body's feeling, as for instance when you
strike any part of the body. 438 Aut from the attraction probably

round and smooth mixed with others round but rough which give it its
saltness 3 and these latter by filtering you may separate from the former.
