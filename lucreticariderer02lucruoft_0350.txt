‘nireo velatus amictu] 1199 Vertier refers to another habit of
Roman worship: the supplianb approached in such a way as to have the
statue of the god on his right and then after praying wheeled to the
right so as to front ita, and then prostrated himself : προσκυνεῖν περιφερο-
μένους; Suet. Vitell. 2 capite velato circmnvertensque se, deinde procum·
beus3 Plau‘n. curo. 69 quo me vertam neseio. ΡΑ. Si deos salutas, dextro·

Aesonides, ‘zonaque adeunt pariterque precari Incipiunt. „defctrum pariter
vertuntur in orbem: vertuntur being rellexive, as Vertier here, and lv
295 convertitur, 317 convertier. Livy has convertentem 8e; Pliny cor-
pus circumayere. acl lapidem would seem to be most simply taken
as said contemptuously of the statue. But since we find lapis, sacer
lapis, lapis unctus, uozyuine delibutus, coronatus and the like, said
especially of the termini which were solemnly worshipped, but also of
stones set up in the streets and roads, etc. occurring so often in all
periods, Lucr. may refer to them: comp. Tib. 1 1 113 Prop. 1 4 24 3.
Ov. fasti 11 6413 Sen. Hipp. 5283 Apul. flor. 15 Sic. Flaccus p. 141 l. 4

πάντα λίθον, τὸ δὴ λεγόμενον, προσκυνοῦντες. These lapides were generally
mere stones; but: Min. F el. 3 has lapides, effiyiatos saue et unctos et
coronatos, referring to a simulacrum Sarapidis in the open air 3 which
again would leave the meaning of Lucr. uncertain. 1200 procumbere:
see Suet. l. l. pandere palmas: Aen. 111 263 passis de litore palmis
Numina mayua vocat: so tendere palmas, manus duplices, etc. etc.
1202 vota are here the votivae tabulae or tabellae, hung up on the wall
of a temple or elsewhere, Aen. ΧΠ 766 on an oleaster 3 Ov. met. vm 744
on a quercus: vittae mediam memoresque tabellae Sertaque cinqebaut,
voti arqumenta potentis: comp. too Apul. met. VI 3 and 29 3 in fulfilment
of a vow on recovery from sickness or for escape from some disaster,
especially shipwreck: Tib. 1 3 27; Cic. de nab. 111 89 3 and so Virgil
Horace Juvenal Persius and others 3 but vows were also thus offered
prospectively, before the danger was past? Prop. v (lv) 3 175 Juv. ΧΠ

1204 Nam: it is ‘crue piety, not to perform these ceremonies, but,
to have a mind at ease3 for it, requires great strength of mind and a.
knowledge of the true being of the godS, nob ‘oo be overpowered by the
grandeur and terrorfo} nature. 1205 fimum only means fast in its
place and abiding, for he grants it to be probable that the sphere of ether
