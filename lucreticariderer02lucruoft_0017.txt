than they did under this baneful influence. Epicurus of course Lucretius
would study for other purposes than those of style, in which he would
have found him but a sorry master3 but the Greek writers still wholly
or partly extant, whom, to judge by his imitations of them, he most
loved and admired, were Homer Euripides Empedocles Thucydides and
Hippocrates. Doubtless too he had carefully studied the old philoso-
phers Democritus Anaxagoras and Heraclitus, but mainly for their
philosophy. Plato he would seem to have known something of from
more than one passage of his poem. His illustrious contemporary Cicero
had like him an intense esteem for Ennius, a profound contempt for the
⁸ cantores Euphorionis' who presumed to despise Ennius. Many years
before Lucretius wrote his poem Cicero in boyhood had translated the
works of Aratus. This translation of which large fragments are pre-
served shews much spirit and vivacity of language, though its poetical
nierits cannot be mentioned beside those of Lucretius. Yet the latter
strangely enough, moved it may be by his general admiration for the
man, had made this youthful production one of his models of style, as
may be demonstrated, not by one or two, but by twenty manifest imita-
tions of the few hundred lines still existing. In poetica] diction and
metrical skill Lucretius has surpassed not only this boyish essay, but
doubtless their common master Ennius as well 3 for the first inventor is
naturally left behind by his followers. Yet Lucretius undoubtedly
wished it to be known that the latter was his master and model in Latin
poetry. Free from all jealousy and empty pretension, he took every
opportunity of acknowledging his obligations to those to whom he felt
indebted: first and foremost to Epicurus who shewed the path which
leads to truth and reason without which all other gifts were vain, and
after him to Democritus and the other early Greek philosophers. Em-
pedocles receives his homage partly as one of these, but mainly because
he gave him the best model of a philosophical poem. Ennius is extolled
at the beginning of his work as his master in Latin verse. Lucretius
thus to all appearance stood aloof from the swarm of contemporary poets

⁴ and left them to quarrel and fight among themselves, as even the best of

them seem to have been ready to do. The Augustan poets of the first
rank afford a rare and most pleasing example of brotherly harmony and
good feeling 5 but if Catullus and Calvus had not died in early manhood,
there are many indications that they and their school would have come
into painful collision with Virgil and Horace and their partisans.
Notwithstanding the antique tinge which for poetica] ends helias
given to his poem, the best judges have always looked upon it as one of
the purest models of the Latin idiom in the age of its greatest perfection.
Fifty vouchers might be cited for this; but the following will suffice:
Scaliger declares emphatically that there is no better writer than Lucre-
tius of the Latin language. Lambinus and Lachmann have scarcely
