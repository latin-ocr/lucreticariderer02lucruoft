Illud in his rebus lonqefche credere cet.: and argued that after all his
mode of supporting his earth in space did not so much differ from theirs5
but what he objected to in them was their making the universe finite,
our one mundus in fact, which he argues could not be held together
amid an infinite void: atonis infinite in number are always streaming
up on all sides to supply our world. The stoic Manilius 1 194 from
the earth argues to the mundus, his universe: Nec vero tibi natura
admiranda videri Pendentis terrae debet, cum pendeat ipse Allundus

you can tell for certain that the moon is of the same size as it looks;
but you cannot tell whether its light is its own or borrowed3 whereas
unphilosophical astronomers assert that its light must be borrowed,
and that it is thousands of times larger than it appears: see remarks
