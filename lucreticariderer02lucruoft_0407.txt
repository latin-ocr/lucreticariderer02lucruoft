1247-1251 appear like 1225 to be out of place and unconnected
with what precedes and follows : they refer also to the same matter as
that verse, 130 the neglect of the usual rites of burial: Lucr. in all this
part of his poem follows the order of Thuc: well 1246 concludes the
topios contained in Thuc. 513 1252 commences the questions with which
Thuc. 52 opens: both then dwell in the same order on 13110 orowding of
people from the country into the town and the terrible mortality caused
thereby ; speak of the dead bodies piled up in the streets and by the
fountains3 the temples crammed with corpses: Thuc. then goes 011 10 say
νόμοι τε πάντες συνεταράχθησαν, οἷς ἐχρῶντο πρότερον περὶ τοῖς ταφείς, ἔθαπ-
τον δὲ ὦς ἕκαστος {Stra-ro: SO too Lucr. 127’8, as if like Thue. he were
entering on a new question, begins Nec mos ille sepulturae cet. and in
four verses paraphrases the words just cited : Thuc. then continues, καὶ
πολλοὶ ἐς ἀναισχύντους θήκας ἐτράποντο σπάνει τῶν ἐπιτηδείων διὰ τὸ συχ-
νούς ἤδη προτεθνοίναι σφίσινε and similarly Lucr. 1282 001111111105 1115

ἀλλοτρίας, φθάσαντες τοὺς νήσαντας, οἱ μὲν ἐπιθέντες τὸν ἑαυτῶν νεκρὸν
ὑφῆπτονε these simple words Lucr. expresses with some poetica] em-
bellishment in the last four vss. of his poem: Thuc. completes the above
sentence with this clause, οἱ δὲ καιομένου ἄλλου ἄνωθεν ἐπιβαλόντες ὃν
φέροιεν ἀπῄεσαν : the meaning of these words is given with similar em-
bellishment in the vss. 1247-1251 which we are now considering. As
the end of the poem is in an unfinished state, and as these vss. as well
as 1225 are clearly out of place having no connexion either of sense or
grammar with the context, is it not probable that they, like so many
others, are incomplete sketches and marginal additions of the poet's,
which he intended, but did not live, to embody with the rest of the poem,
and which his editors, not knowing what else to do, put into their present
place, almost it may be at hap-hazard'l Lachmann's treatment of these
vss. is highly unsatisfactory: cernebant is a violent change, and the
lacrimis lassi luctuque redibant he refers to the lookers on who had
something else to do in attending on their sick 3 not to those who had
struggled to bury their dead, though that must be their meaning3 nay
it seems to me almost certain that the poet means by these words to
express the ἀπῄεσαν of Thuc. l. 1. 1247 Inque aliis alium has at
