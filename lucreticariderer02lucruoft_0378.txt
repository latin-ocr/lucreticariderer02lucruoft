370 BOOK VI NOTES II

καὶ κατ’ ἄλλους δὲ τρόπους πλείους τοῖς κινήσεις ταύτας τῆς ’γῆς γίνεσθαιε
Seneca devotes the whole of the sixth book of his nat. quaest. to the
same subject 3 chap. 20 recounts first the theories of Democritus, and
then of Epicurus: Seneca here and in what precedes and follows illus·
trates Lucr. better than Epicurus does, having had access of course
to larger works of the latter: veniamus nunc ad eos qui omnia ista
quae rettuli in causa esse disserunt aut ex his plura. Democritus
plura putat. ait enim motum aliquando spiritu fieri, aliquando aqua,
aliquando utroque, just as Lucr. 3 then 20 5 omnes istas posse esse causas
Epicurus ait pluresque alias temptat et alios qui aliquid unum existis
esse adfirmaverunt corripit cet. 3 he then proceeds to employ wind ancl
water in much the same way as Lucr. does. 538 and 552 lucunas:
see n. to 111 1031. 538 lucunas, to distinguish it from lacus, may
mean here chasms not filled with water, a sense it often bears, though
552 he says in maynas aquae vastasque lucunasj, which would also shew
that lucunas cannot well mean small pools in contradistinction to lacus 3
so that in fact it may be a mere poetical tautology‚ as 539 rupes derup-
taque saxa: comp. 1 115 vastasque lacunas and n. there. 542 similem
cet. : this appears to follow from Epicurus⁷ ἰσονομία or as Cicero de nat.
1 50 translates it aequabilis tributio ‚· ut omnibus omnia paribus paria
respondeant. 543 subi. supp. must surely have their litera] sense,
referring to what he has just said is below ground. Creech plainly and
Lamb. apparently take the meaning to be, ‘these points being assumed
and taken for granted': the latter says τούτων δή ὑποκειμένων καὶ ιῖποτε-
θέντων; but I find no authority whatever for giving the Latin words the
metaphorical meaning which these Greek words have, and Lamb. may
have used them too in their litera] sense. 544 superne tremit cet.: so
Epic. according to Seneca l. l.f01·tasse aliqua pars terrae velut columnis
quibusdam ac pilis sustinetur, quibus vitiatis ac recedentibus tremit pon-
dus impositum. 547 disserpunt I find only here. 549 non maqno
pondere and tota gain point and force by being placed together and
divided from plaustri and Tecta respectively ; but yet the wide separa-
tion of plaustri and non mayno pondere is harsh: but see n. to 1v 905
pondere mayno. Sen. epist. 90 9 lonyo vehiculorum ordine vicis intre-
