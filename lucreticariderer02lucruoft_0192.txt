There is a contemptuous irony in these last vss. not unlike what Cicero
Tusc. 1 41 uses: alter (Aristoxenus) ita delectatur suis cantibus ut eos
etiam ad haec transferre conetur. harmoniam autem ex intervallis sono-
rum nosse possumus...membrorum vero situs et fiyura corporis vacans
animo quam possit harmoniam efficere non video. secl hic quidem, quamv.-
vis eruditus sit, sicut est, haec maqistro concedat Aristoteli, canere ipse
doceat: Cicero means to say his master would have taught him better on
this head, though he were a better teacher of singing himself: comp.

Bernays die Dialoge des Arist. p. 14 foll. says, in his celebrated dialogue
Eudemus where this theory was discussed and refuted: in p. 27 is quoted
from Philoponus a very interesting fragment of this dialogue bearing on
the argument mentioned by Lucr. 102 Ut bona saepe valetudo cet: it
concludes εἰ τοίνυν ἦ ἀναρμοστία (τοῦ σώματος) νόσος καὶ ἀσθένεια καὶ
αἶσχος, ἦ ἁρμονία ἄρα ὑγίεια καὶ ἰσχὺς καὶ κάλλος. ψυχὴ δὲ οὐδέν ἐστι
τούτων, οὔτε ὑγίεια, φημί, οὔτε ἷσχύς οὔτε κάλλος. ψυχήν γὰρ εἶχεν καὶ
ὁ Θερσίτης αἴσχιστος ὤν· οὐκ ἄρα ἐστὶν ἦ ψυχὴ σῖρμονία. The peripa-
tetics at this time began to make a great stir, and Lucr. appears more
hostile to them than to any except the stoics: their philosophy was in
most points very adverse to his. On the above question comp. ιΑΙθΧ.

136—160: the animus and the anima make up one nature, but the
animus is the ruling part in the whole body and is situated in the region
of the heart3 the anima being spread through the body: sometimes the
animus feels, when the (mima does not, but under any violent emotion
we see the anima sympathise throughout the frame with the animus: the
anima therefore is united with the animus, and, being moved by it, stirs
the whole body. 136 coniuncta: the neut. as usual when referred
to two subst. of different genders: but 416 Hoc anima atque animus
vincti sunt foedere semper; 1v 1009 Accipitres . .persectantes visaeque
volantes: 66 Ι have obeyed Lamb. and Lach. in reading Sernota . . viden-
tur for videtur: the change is slight 3 but perhaps it is wrong to refuse
to Lucr. the same liberty which other writers claim: Cic. pro Cluent. 146
