their unrivalled excellence ; in translating Panaetius or Philodemus he
would feel his own imrneasurable superiority.

In three places Lucretius complains of the poverty of his native
tongue: Ι 136 116 says in general terms that he is aware how difficult it
is to express in Latin verses the abstruse discoveries of the Greeks. But
could a Greek poet express them in Greek verses ’1 could a Homer or
even a Euripides expound the theories of Aristotle or Chrysippus or
Epicurus more clearly than Lucretius? Surely not: in the second book
he has translated some anapaests of Euripides that consummate master
of matured Attio, and there is no thought in them which he cannot ex-
press literally. Certainly in difficult questions Empedocles is more help-
less than Lucretius, though he had an epic diction to imitate which had
existed for centuries. The second passage is 1 830 foll. where he ob-
serves that the poverty of his native speech does not permit him to
express in Latin Anaxagoras’ homoeomeria, but the meaning he can
expound easily enough. And easily and lucidly enough he does explain
it: the less he 01· any other poet Latin or Greek or English has to do
with the word itself the better: it is not more poetical than entelechia
or homoeusia, or the τό τί ἧν εἶναι 115611. The third passage is 111 218
foll. where he says that he would fain explain at greater length the way
in which the different substances which compose the soul are mixed and
work together, but the poverty of his native speech compels him to be
brief. Whether he is brief or not, he explains an intricate question as
clearly as any Greek writer in prose or verse would be likely to do. One
might more justly object to Lucretius that he has too much instead of
too little technical language for a poet. Whatever Greek writer Cicero
wishes to explain, he can find adequate Latin terms to express the
Greek, even if they are those of Plato or Aristotle: is it a new sense
given to a word in common use? he can always meet λόγος 01· εἶδος with
ratio or species : is it a newly coined word? his qualitas is quite as good
as Plato's ποιότης. Nay froin the force of circumstances species qualitas
quantitas have had a much longer life and a far more extended applica-
tion than εἷδος ποιότης and ποσότης. Had Cicero chosen to apply the
prolific energy 01 1115 intellect to the task, he might have invented and
wedded to beautiful langua ge as copious a terminology as was afterwards
devised by the united efforts of Tertullian and the other fathers, Aqui-
nas and the other schoolmen3 from which the most cultivated modern
languages derive the chief portion of that wealth in scientific ternis
which enables them to claim in that respecta superiority over Latin.
But the language of Latin poetry would assuredly not have been iln-
proved thereby. That however he, like Cicero, sometimes entertained a
more favourable opinion 01 1115 language and his art would appear from
such expressions as the twice recurring quod obscura de re tam lucida
panqo Carmina, musaeo continqens cuncta lepore.
