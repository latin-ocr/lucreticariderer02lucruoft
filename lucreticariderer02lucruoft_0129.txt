that these vss of Homer may have suggested the fashion to wealthy Ro-
mans. 2¹7 fulqet: v 1049 sciret animoque is the only other instance
of this licence in Lucr. which is much more frequent in Virgil: there is
no analogy between this practice and the lengthening of such syllables in
Ennius: with him they were really long, and in thesis as well as arsis,
uter esset induperator and the like: in Lucr. and Virgil the lengthening
is a mere licence permitted in the arsis alone. 28 why an editor
should object to aurata in Lucr. because auro occurs in 27 Ι do not com—

a necessity with the Romans3 the custom is spoken of by Virgil Horace

usual subjunctive, tended to preserve this indic. so usual in the
older writers] The sequence of the whole sentence is this, Si non
