1039 mat. vetustas: 1113 age at his death is variously given fron] 90 to
109 years. 1040 memores motus would produce memory, and thereby
‘the power of consistent thought, just as the semiferi motus produce
sense. Lucr. by placing Democritus here would seem to give him rank
next to Epicurus.

1042 obit decurso: Lach. in 1113 elaborate note, after attempting to
prove that the last syll. of iit and its conipounds 13 always long, proceeds
to shew that Lucr. could not have used the contracted form obit before a
consonant: why? because the poets have three different usages in
regard to these forms 3 a few, Phaedrus Seneca and Silius, admit them
only before consonants 01· at the end of a verse 3 the old comic poets
either before a vowel or consonant 5 most, Virgil Ovid Lucan Statius
Martial and others, only before a vowel: now Lucr. twice uses them
before a vowel, 1v 339 (314) Ater init oculos, 771 perit alioqum unless
therefore he chose to descend to the level of a comic poet, he could not
also say obit decurso, as he had taken his stand on the other practice.
This curicus conclusion is refuted by Luc. Mueller de re metr. p. 399 in
a few lines: Martia] Lucan and Statius are placed by Lach. in the third
and most correct class, but Martia] not only says 1 62 6 abit Helene, 11
64 3 transit et Nestoris aeta33 but also lib. spect. 16 1 Raptus abit media,
x 77 2perit fenim Lucan not only has abit αηί, but also IX 205 obit
Pompeio, 1098 perit caruere 3 Statius not only subit ibi and the like, but
also Theb. VII 439 init fecitque, X 205 abit non: these instances are
given by Mueller. In addition Lucan V111 85 has perit quod, 321 abit
aut unde redit maiore in one v.; J uv. v1 559 obit et, 563 perit cui.
What Lach. says of Virgil has some apparent support from mss„ though
that means little or nothing, as a large proportion of the oldest mss. of
certain authors always write -it for -iitt Augustus in his res gestae has
adit, where he meant I presume adiit. Taking then into account that
poet's usual rhythm it seems almost inoredible that he should five times
have written exit, emit, transit, transit, transit, never once divided the
word between two feet, exit etc.; nor used it in the 6th foot3 Martial
