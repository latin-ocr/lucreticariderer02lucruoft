seems different 3 see n. there. totum corpus et artus: he has many
such pleonasms 3 though this might be explained ‘through the body gene-
rally and each of its parts': so 282 per membra per artus-5 1v 887 quae

seems like similis ut si qui, tamquam si, quasi, which occur in Cicero:
Pomponius 74 Simile est quasi cum ficlyit 5 [Plaut. epid. 621 Est con—
similis quasi cum cet] ictu depends on impulsi. 285 foll. see
Cic. de fato quoted at 251 : the passage tallies exactly with this 3
pondus and playa denote there, as here, the natural and the impressed
motion of atoms. 288 foll. Lucr. too, like Cicero 1. 1., assigns
the freeclom of the will as the chief proof of the necessity of this
third motion: the natural gravity of 3101115 gives them, says Lucr., a
certain independence and power of resisting extraneous force3 but the
mind itself 6311 only escape from inexorable necessity and acquire free-
dom of action by this fitful declination of atoms. 289 necessum est is
used several times by Lucr. as well as by Plautus and Livy: but Lach.
130 v1 815 justly observes that necessum used as it is here with 311 epithet
is singular enough. 291 serre patique: so Mart. ΧΠ 26 8 : Livy x 11

perferet and 1116 like, [Servius Sulpicius ap. Cic. epist. 1v 5 3 llaec

declinatio or inclinatio.

This theory has naturally enough drawn down on Epicurus 1116 sooffs
of his many adversaries : res tota ficta pueriliter, says Cicero z 1116 whole
business is contradiction and ridiculous nonsense, echoes Bentley in his
Boyle lectures. Even his friends have mostly here deserted him: Marul-
lus, one of the most enthusiastic of them, writes in the margin of Mon.
‘absurditas' ‘insania ⁷. Yet there is something grand and poetical in 115
very simplicity. He wished, like other thinkers, 10 derive his system

from as few first principles as possible: he saw in mind his atoms de- -

scending from all eternity in uniform blind motion. How then was ex-
istence possible‘l a sentient first cause was to him inconceivable. This
minimum of declination then, this perpaulum quo nihil posset esse minus,
rose before his reason ancl imaginaffion, as the simplest theory which
would solve the great problem of being, of the creation of this and all
other worlds with all that is in them. What system-monger but some—
where or other reaches a point where reason must be silent or self-contra-
dictory? In a curious memoir of the Berlin transactions for 1782 by
Gr. L. Le Sage, called Lucrece Neutonien‚ the author ingeniously argues
that if Epicurus had had but a part of 1116 geometrical knowledge of say
his contemporary Euclid, and conceptions of cosmography the same as
