cannot see, because their particles can pass by crooked ways, while
images can only travel through straight passages: again one voice bursts
into many similar voices, as a spark of fire into many sparks3 so that all
the corners of a building may be filled with sound3 but even sound is
deadened and broken in coming through such obstructions. 598 Con-
loquiwn cet.: see notes 1: there is in this a mixture of seeing and
hearing, exactly as in Hor. sat. 11 8 77 tum in lecto quoque videres

probably its confusion with the adjective has saved the ei here: for the

away from the sight, they are filled with the sounds which circle all
about them. retro: Sen. Hipp. 93 per altas invii retro lacus Vadit

out from food by chewing and passes into the pores of tongue and
palate: the flavour is pleasant, if its atoms are smooth, but the con-

flavour is no longer perceived‚ and. the food is then indifferent, if only
it can be digested. 615 qui: see n. to V 233. 619 coepit: neither
Ritschl pref. to trinummus p. LXXVI nor Lach. can find another certain

well established3 as merc. 533 Ecastor iam biennium& quom mecum
