111 37 ut identidem primos quosque locos imaqinum renovandarum causa
animo pervaqemus 3 Livy XLII 32 7 cum tribuni militum, qui centuriones
essent, primum quemque citarent: and so v 291 primum iactum fulqoris
quemque perire: also 264 primum quicquid aquai, 284 primum quicquid
ficlqoris, 304 primum quicquid flammarum, Lucretius loving the archaism
quicquid for quicque, as has been said above. 392 iol fieri, i.e. that
what has been described takes place, because the air is able to condense
itself, and so also to expand where necessary: the subj. shewing it was
the erroneous judgment of the thinker, as quia linquant in 383: Oreech
argues that some vss. are lost here ; but I cannot gather from his note
that he had any clear conception of how he meant the lacuna to be filled
up. Lucr. is curt and elliptical because he would not I think have found
it easy to state fully what seemed to him an absurdity. The power of
the air in 392 to condense implied thereby the power of expanding3 and
395 seems to me distinctly to prove that 392 contains the gist of the
argument: they assert that the air condenseS, but it cannot condense
without vacuum z a vacuum is formed where it did not exist before, i.e.
between the two bodies which have separated: a vacuum is filled which
existed before, i.e. somewhere on the outer sides of the two bodies.
392 condenseat and 395 denserier: Lucr. appears only to know the 2nd
conjug: see notes 1 to v 491. 396 si iam posset: see n. to 968.
397 trahere neut. as vl 1190 nervi trahere: see n. to vl 595 : perhaps in
our passage Lucr. means to imply the contraction would have taken
place without apparent cause. part. cond. in un. repeated 111 534 ipsam
se posse per artus Introsum trahere et partis conducere in unum: 1 650
conductis partibus: which seems to prove that trahere here: se trahere.
398—41'7 z much more might Ι say; but a keen intellect can now by
itself pursue the question farther: if however you demur, I have such
store of arguments in reserve, that our life will come to an end sooner
than they. 398 Virg. ecl. IX 56 Causando nostros in lonqum ducis
amores. 400 possum: Virg. geor. 1 176 Possum multa tibi veterum
praecepta referre 3 Cic. pro Caelio 53 possum dicere...possum etiam illa...
perquirere... possum omnes latebras suspicionum peraqrare dicendo . . sed
haec... 3 pro Sestio 7 possum multa dicere de. . sed... 3 in Verr. (11) 1 125
possum sexcenta decreta perfirre...verum... ι the usage is very common,
analogous with that of poteram, potui, etc. in conditional sentences.
401 conradere is twice used in VI in its litera] sense. 402 saqaci: see
n. to 502 the metaph. is kept up in vestiyia ς and the expressions natu-
rally lead to the simile: comp. saqaoc nasum of Plautus, nare sayaci of
Ennius. 404 ‘montivaqae agrees with ferai, as shewn by 11 597 and
1081 : Soph. Phil. 943 θῆρ’ ὀρειβάτην. 405 quietes: I find no other
instance of the word in this sense 3 but Cic. de off. 1 103 and Sall. Cat.
