be taken away, not all: also much of the eyeball‚ not all. 412 sine

gen. eorum too I now see has no proper reference to what precedes3 and
in other places, as 111 1016, IV 43, 68, 101 and 116, is found without
meaning at the end of a v, et orbei I now read: if et were absorbed in

omnem for omnei. We have seen in n. to 208 how often Lucretius and
others have etiam quoque, quoque etiam, quoquc item and the like ; we
have seen too that six times at least he has et for etiam, which is found
in Cicero. Now Cic. Verr. 11 1 11 has erunt qui etin eo quoque auda-

417—444: this soul and mind (we may now use the terms indif-
ferently) have a birth and are morta13 for they are of the smallest and
finest 31301115, being more easily moved than anything else, even by images
of the rarest things, smoke mist and the like 3 35 these things then
melt into air, so must the soul when severed from the body dissolve even
more quickly: how indeed, when the body cannot keep it, could. the air
which is much rarer hold it together 2—Martha‚ p. 149, thinks it pro-
bable that his 28 proofs of the soul's mortality were taken from some
formal treatise. I have no doubt they were all set forth in one of the
37 books of Epicurus περὶ φύσεως. Zeller well observes that, with the
stoics, the soul keeps the body together 3 with the epicureans, the body
the soul. 41¹7 Nunc aye, as he now passos to a new branch of the
