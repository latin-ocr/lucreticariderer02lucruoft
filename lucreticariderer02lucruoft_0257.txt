seems to belong to the notion of night: it appears to be the opposite to
what is gay and smiling : Ov. met. V11 184 has mediae per muta silentia
noctis. 462 comp. 590 Cetera de qenere hoc monstra ac portenta
loquontur. . .ideo iactant miracula dictis 3 and v 845. 463 violare fidem
usually means to break your own saith, here it means to impair the
credit of others: but 505 Et violare fldem primam convellere tota Fun-
damenta, the sense is much the Same as here: 1 694 Et labefactat eos
i. e. sensus unde omnia credita pendent. 464 foll. Tertull. de anima 17
non enim sensum mentiri sed opinionem: sensum enim pati, non opinari ,-
animam enim opinari. 465 opinatus seems a ἅπαξ λεγόμ. for opinatio:
with opinatus animi quos addimus ipsi, ancl 467 res secernere apertas Ab
dubiis, animus quas ab se protinus addit comp. Epic. himself in Diog. x
50 τὸ δὲ ψεῦδος καὶ τό διημαρτημένον ἐν τῷ προσδοξαζομένῳ οἶεί ἐστι κατὰ τὴν
κίνησιν ἐν ’ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς, συμνημμένην τῇ φανταστικῇ ἐπιβολῇ, διάλειψιν (not
διάληψιν) δ’ ἔχουσαν καθ’ ἣν τὸ ψεῦδος γίνεται; and comp. all that follows
with Sextus adv. math. v11 210f011.: Epicurus shews that every percep-
tion is true 3 but that some opinions are true, some false, and points out
how the true are to be distinguished from the false3 Cic. acad. pr. 11 45
discitque (Epicurus) sapientis esse opinionem a perspicuitate seiunyere:
perspicuitas is his translation of Epicurus’ ἐνάργεια. With respect to
one of the cases put by Lucr. above, Cic. l. 1. 80 says Timayoras epicureus
neyat sibi umquam, cum oculum torsisset, duas ex lucernaflammulas esse
visas ; opinionis enim esse mendacium, non oculorum. It appears from
this book of Cicero that the ship of 387 foll. and the bent oar of 438
were also stock illustrations in the schools: Macrob. sat. V11 14 enume-
rates others as well as these. 468 ab se=ipse: 465 addimus ipsi:
nearly the same is its force 111 271 initum motus ab se quae dividit ollis;

469—521: if a man teaches that nothing can be known, how does he
know that? how distinguish between knowing and not knowing? on the
truth of the senses all reasoning depende, which must be false if they are
false: nor is one sense more certain than another3 all being equally true 3
nor is the same sense at one time more certain than at another: all
reasoning‚ nay life itself would at once come to an end, if the senses are
not to be trusted 3 as in any building, if the rule and square are wry,
every part will be crooked and unstable, so all reasoning must be false,
if the senses on which it is grounded are false. 469 nil sciri cet. refers
no doubt to the academica] philosophy which as said in Cic. acad. pr. 11
61 confundit vera cum j'atsis, spoliat nos iudicio, privat adprobatione,
omnibus orbat sensibus: comp. too Macrob. sat. v11 14 20 where the pre-
ceding illustrations of Lucr. are referred to, quae academicis damnando-
rum sensuum occasionem dederunt. But in Cio. 1. 1. 75 it is also said of
Chrysippus, qui fulcire putatur porticum stoicorum, quam multa ille
