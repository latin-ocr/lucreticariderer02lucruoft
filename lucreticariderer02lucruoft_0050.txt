what has been said of the small respect which the latter shewed to Epi-
curus and epicureans. 104 finq. som.: Virg. ecl. V111 108 ipsi sibi
somnia finqunt. 105 verterezevertere in Virg. Aen. 1 20 11 652 x 88:
also in Horace Ovid and perhaps Cicero, as shewn by Forc. 106 tur-
bare: Wak. compares Aen. xl 400 omnia maqno Ne cessa turbare metu.
107 Et merilo; nam: Ov. met. lx 585 Et merito ,· quid enim cet. ceo-cam
finem: finis is always fem. in Lucr.: the 11155. 11 1116 have eoetremum

finem which Lach. rightly alters. 109 Reliy. often used by Lucr. in -

the plur. for religious fears or scruples: he twice has reliqionum nodis
eaesolvere, shewing that he felt reliqio to be connected with reliqare, as
does Cic. de domo 105 nisi etium muliebribus reliyionibus te implicuisses,
though elsewhere he derives it from releyere. F ick vergl. woerterb. p.
488 traces it to a root signifying ‘to care for', ‘to trouble one's self for',
connecting it with ἀλέγω, ἄλγος, etc. (Homer Διὸς οὐκ ἀλέγων); nec-leqo

‘not to care for'. 110 restandi common enough 111 the poets for
resistendi: 566 F orc.: Livy 1v 58 4 summa vi restare, [XXIII 45 9 nwnc
paucis plures vix restans] 111 Lach. here and v 302 adds est omitted

in mss. because, he sayS, it cannot be omitted after the gerund, unless
an infin. esse or a conipound of esse follow. I have followed him in
both places, but with hesitation, as Serv, to Aen. xl 230 quotes our
verse without est. Lucretius has at least a dozen instances of the acc.
after the gerund, instead of the participia] constr.; [see Roby Gram. pt.
11 p. LXX113] but the accus. is gen. a plur. except 111 626 eumfaciundum
est, and 926 mortem putandwnst: comp. Serv. 1. 1. where pacem
petendum is read on his authority and that of other grammarians
against the best mss: Livy XLII 5 6 the ancient and sole ms. has
acl spernendum pacem3 but Gronov and Madvig change it to spernen-
dam: the constr. is known to Cicero Cato 6 viam, quam nobis quoque
inyrecliumlum sit.

113 two theories of the origin of the soul3 the true one that it is
born with the body, the false that it enters the body at the body's birth:
114—116 three theories of the soul after death, first the true one that
when severed from the body, it dies with it 3 secondly the false one that
it enters Orcus 3 thirdly the equally false one that it migrates into some
other living creature: Ennius believed in the Pythagorean transmigra-
tion of souls, and therefore in the ‘And and false theory of the soul's
origin and the 3rd and false one of its migration after death: ann. 10
Ova parire solet qenu' pinnis condecoratum, Non animam ,· et post inde
venit divinilu' pullis Ipsa anima. 114 dirempta refers of course to
visat and insinuet se, as well as to intereat. 115 lacunas may mean
pools of water, as v 794, VI 552 3 or merely hollows, chasms, as apparently
VI 538, and Cic. Arat. 427 Insula discessit disiectaque saxa revellens
Perculit et caecas lustravit luce lacunas. 116 pecudes alias seems
clearly a Grecism, like Herod. 1 216 θύουσί μιν καὶ ἄλλα πρόβατα ἅμα
