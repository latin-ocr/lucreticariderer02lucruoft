BOOK 1v NOTES 11 265

above this passage connects itself directly with that ending at 776, and
continues the question of images which strike the mind in sleep.

823 (822)--857: pray do not think that the parts of the body have
been given us in order to be used3 in truth their use arose long after
their first existence: before the eyes there was no seeing, before the
tongue no speaking ,- on the other hand the instruments of peace and
war we know to have been invented after their use was known 3 not so
the senses and the limbs, which you must not believe to have had a final
cause, as swords and shieldS, cups and beds had.-—This passage too, as
Lach. has proved to demonstration, interrupts the regular sequence of
the argument, and must be a subsequent addition of the poet’s: see the
introduct-cry remarks to 11 165—183, where I have stated how Lach.
brings the present into comparison with cognate passages in 11 and v.
823 Illud cet.: the argument is well put by Lactant. inst. 111 17 with
evident reference to Lucr. of whom he was a diligent student, neque
oculi succi sunt ad videndum neque aures ad audiendum neque linqua ad
loquendum ‘neque pedes ad ambulandum, quoniam prius haec nata sunt
quam esset loqui audire videre ambulare. itaque ‘non haec ad usum nata
sunt, sed usus em illis natus est. avessza like prolcibessis habessit licessit

In the first conj. these forms are exceedingly common, amussis and
a hundred others. [On such forms see VVestphal Verbalflexion p.

lv 265 says ‘avet i. avide cupit. sic Lucretius saepe ponit'; and this is
quite true. 824 ρναευιθίιιθηιεν, another ἅπαξ λεγόμ. 826 prof qu.

‘ministras manus natura homini dedit, says the stoic Balbus in the
middle of his strenuous defence of final causes. No doubt the zeal
with which the stoics maintained this doctrine added vehemenoe to
Lucretius’ denunciations. Arist. de part. anim. lv 10 p. 687 8 in the
midst of his long and brilliant statement on the side of the final cause
quotes Anaxagoras' famous saying διὰ τὸ χεῖρας ἔχειν φρονιμώτατον εἶναι
τῶν ζῴων ἄνθρωπον, and retorts εὔλογον δὲ διοῖ τὸ φρονιμώτατον εἶναι χεῖρας
λαμβάνειν, and a few lines after οὔ διὰ τας χεῖράς ἐστιν ὁ ἅνθρωπος φρονι-
