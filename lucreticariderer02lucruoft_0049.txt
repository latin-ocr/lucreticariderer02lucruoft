here as elsewhere that Lucr. had carefully studied Euripides: 94 we saw
is almost a translation of a line of Iph. Aul. Again with 98 99
comp. 1178 foll. of that play, α’πώλεσέν σ’, ὦ τέκνον, ὁ φυτεύσας πατήρ
Αὐτὸς κτανών, οὐκ ἄλλος οὐδ’ ἄλλῃ χερί, and 1315 ὦ δυστάλαιν’ ἐγώ...
φονεύομαι διόλλυμαι Σφαγαῖσιν ἀνοσίοισιν ἀνοσίου πατρός; and With 101
comp. 1334 μεγάλα πάθεα κ.τ.λ. where Helen takes the place of religion.
Again one of the most striking things in this description is the allusion
to the rites of marriage: now just after the passage last quoted Achilles,
to whom Iphigenia was betrothed, enters on the scene and offers to
rescue his bride from death.

102—145: you will yourself at times fall away from me, frightened
by vain tales of eterna] punishment, which men adopt from ignorance of
the soul; about the nature of which there are many false theories: one
is that of transmigration adopted by Ennius : his hell being peopled only
by phantoms of the living. I must therefore in addition to what I have
already promised explain the true nature of the soul, as well as of those
idols which frighten us in sickness or sleep. The task is difficult3 but
my love and admiration of you, Memmius, encourage me to labour to
make these questions clear. 102 Tutemet or tutimet, a rare word
found also 1v 915 and in Ter. heaut: the double suffix is curious 3 but
Lucr. uses also tute ipse. vatum the oldest name for poets, as we are
told by Varro and Enn. ann. 222, afterwards, as is well shewn by Luc.
Mueller de re metr. p. 65 foll„ fell into complete contempt and was
discarcled for poeta: this latter name is given to themselves by Naevius
Ennius Pacuvius, to Homer by Ennius 3 and is used in a good sense by
Cicero Lucr. and Catullus. Virgil and succeeding writers made vates
once more a name of honour and denoted by it an inspired bard, some-
thing higher than poeta, as Virg. ecl. 1X 34: the same again brought into
fashion the antiquated and despised camenae or casmenae, even confound-
ing them with their rivals and conquerors the muses. With Lucr. here
and 109 it is a term of contempt to denote apparently singers of old
prophecies and denouneers of coming ills, like the Marcius of the 2nd
Punic war cited by Livy and Macrobius: comp. Horace's annosa volu-
mina vatum: the epicurean Velleius in Cic. de nat. deor. 1 55 contemp-

1 p. 57 shews that the word is the same as the old Irish fdith, Strabo
mentioning as the three highest classes among the Gauls βάρδοι τε καὶ
οὐοίτεις καὶ δρυίδαι, and explaining οῧάτεις to be ἱεροποιοὶ καὶ φυσιόλογοι.
103 terriloquis: lexicons give no other instance of the use of this word:
Virg. Aen. v 524 has terrifici cecinerunt carmina vates. The poet’s mis-
trust of Memmius here and in 332 is curious and would seem to confirm
