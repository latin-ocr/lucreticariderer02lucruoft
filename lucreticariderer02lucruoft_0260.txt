522-5482 the way in which the other senses are acted upon, may
now be easily understood : sound is corporeal, since it is by striking on
the ear that it excites sensation 3 often too the atoms of sound in passing
through the narrow windpipe graze it and make it rough 5 again a long
speech spoken in a loud voice takes much strength and substance from a
man: smoothness of souncl comes from smoothness of its atonis, roughness
from roughness in them. 522 quo paeto: ‘that is manifestly by
impulse, the only way which we can conceive bodies operate in' says
Locke essay 11 8 11: what follows has many points of singular agreement
with what Lucr. says here and in parts of 11. 523 scruposa: the
metaphor is obvious, though the word doe-s not appear to occur elsewhere
in this sense ; and scrupeus has also this meaning, but only in late
writers. 524 foll. comp. auctor ad Heren. 111 21. 524 auditur

sensus ab his i.e. vocibus pulsus esset. 529 arteria: this neut. form
appears to occur only here. asperiora, perhaps with reference to its
technical name, the aspera arteria, τραχεῖα α’ρτηριάε see Cicero and Celsus
in Fore. 530 coorta is neut. plur.; as it appears to be also in vl 465:
comp. Livy v 12 7 seditio intestina maiore mole coorta: but VI 511 turba
maiore coacta, coacta must be abl. 532 quoque belongs equally to the
three words erpleti ianua oris ; for the meaning is 08 quoque expletur et
eius ianua raditur: the ianua here is the fauces, through which the
voice enters the mouth. expleti: Vl 1203 sanquis expletis naribus ibat:
the word in these two places has doubtless its usual meaning, though
Lach. says the sense which Donatus and Ennius give it of exinanitus
would be appropriate here. 534 laedere: auctor ad Heren. 111 21
laeduntur arteriae si, antequam leui voce permulsae sunt, acri clamore
compleantur. 535 corporis: see n. to 1 1039. 545 sub murmure:
785 Omnia sub verbone creat natura: sub here, as often, signifies ‘at’
‘immediately upon', and sometimes has the same force as the simple abL:
