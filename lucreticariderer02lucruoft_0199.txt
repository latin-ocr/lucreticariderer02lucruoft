which is a sors, a patrimony or capital, which cannot be divided, but
must be used by them in common: comp. ciris 14 Si me iam summa

Sors, where the aroc is the joint sors of the four. 333 Nec sibi quaeque:
suus or sui with which quisque goes so naturally, allows of quaeque
being said of either of two: so Cic. pro Rosc. com. 32,- Livy 11 7 1;

yet the negative Nec quaeque for nec utra or ‘nec altera seems harsh.

sensus: comp. 11 943 and 959. This doctrine of Lucr. that for the pro-
duction of sense and life the body is as necessary to the soul as the soul
is to the body3 that though sensation· must begin with the animus and
proceed to the anima before it can extend to the body, and the sense of
the soul is more active than that of the body, yet the body feels and
lives as well as the soul, is emphatically declared by Epic. in Diog. Laert.

σπείρεται καὶ οὐκέτι ἔχει τοῖς αὐτοῖς δυνάμεις οὐδὲ κινεῖται, ὥστ’ οὐδ’ αἴσθησιν
κέκτηται. οὗ γοὶρ οἷόν τε νοεῖν αὐτὴν αἰσθανομένην, μὴ ἐν τούτῳ τῷ συστήματι

350-357; to say that the body has no sense, and that the soul
spread through it alone feels, is to contradict a sels-evident truth: but it
is said when the soul departs, the body has no sense: yeS, because sense
like much else is no inherent property, but an accident only. 350
refutat: as this cannot be really disproved, but only denied, Lambinus'
renutat is very specious ε but refutat may well imply ‘tries to disprove’ or
‘thinks he disproves'. 353 man. reon: not only true, but manifestly
true. 354 corpus sentirezcorporis sensus: see n. to 1 331. adseret
i.e. rationem adferet: thus we have had more than once reddere:
