344 BOOK V NOTES ΙΙ

Hoc paces habuere bonae ventique secundi looks like a reminiscence
of Lucu: the plur. paces is common enough. animas: see n. to 1 715.
1231 saepe appears to be idiomatical, as in Aen. 1 148, where see
Conington: Lucr. does not mean to say ‘in vain, since he qften perishcs
none the less', but what he means is this ‘since in, every case a man
perishes none the less for all his prayers, as we see by many examples’3
saepe therefore means id quod saepe fieri videmus: though less marked,
it has essentially the same force in such passages as 11 85 and lv 34,
where cum saepe means cum, ut saepe fit: 111 912 ubi discubuere tenentque
Pocula saepe homines i.e. ut saepe fit. turbine corn: VI 395 Turbine
caelesti subito correptus; Aen. Ι 45 Turbine corripuit. 1232 vada
seems to be used at once in a literal and metaphorica] sense: comp.
1289 belli illiscebantfluctus. 1233 vis abdita quaedam, the secret
power and working of nature, the effect of which in particular
cases no man can foretell, however unvarying and inexorable her
laws: v1 26 Quidve mali foret in rebus mortalibu’ passim, Quod fieret
naturali varieque volaret Seu casu seu vi, quod sic natura parasset.
Bayle art. Lucrece n. F accuses Lucr. of gross inconsistency in speaking
of this vis abdita quaedam, when at the same time he attributes all things
to the necessary moveinent of atonis, ‘cause qui ne sait οὐ 6116 va ni ce
qu'elle fait' 3 but this very ‘cause' is the vis abdita quaedam: it is true
that as far as form and expression are concerned there is a struggle
between the poet’s imagination and the philosopher's creed. Lucretius
is here speaking of course generally3 but it is not unlikely that his fancy
may have been caught by reading of some striking disaster of this kind,
such as that of M. Claudius Marcellus who perished in this way just
before the third Punic war, as he was going on an embassy to Masinissa:
M. Marcellus, qui ter consul fuit, summa virtute pietate qloria militari,
periit in mari, says Cicero in Pison. 44 3 he several times refers to his
fate by which he was greatly impressed: Livy epit. L Claudius fllarcellus
coorta tempestate fluctibus obrutus est. 1234 fascis cet: see n. to 111
996. 1237 dubiaeque: comp. 985 validique leonis, 1v 518 ‘ruere ut
quaedam videantur velle ruantque, and n. to 11 825 uno varioque colore.
[1238 se temnunt: Lucil. XI 13 Non contemnere se et reyes odisse super-
bos] 1239 relinqunt: Madvig at end of Henrichsen de frag. Gottorp.
‘non quaeritur quid relinquant, nihil enin] tollunt, sed quid necessarium
putent et propterea excogitent. scrib. requirunt': but relinqunt here
means, to admit, hold, believe, a sense it has again and again in Lucr.
with or without an infin.: 1 742 ‘motus exempto rebus inani Constituunt
et res mollis rarasque relinquont: [and see n. to 1 515 and 7033 111 40]

1241-1280: the metals were discovered through the burning of
woods which baked the earth and caused the ore to run3 with these
they made arnis and tools: copper at first was rated more highly than
useless gold and silver; now it is the contrary ; thus things in turn
