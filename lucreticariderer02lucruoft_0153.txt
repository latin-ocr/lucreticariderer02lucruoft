of the sea, and has nothing in common with v 487, where salsus sudor
is literally the sweat of the earth, or with what is there quoted from
Empedocles. [Ιιαῦεέοε see Seyffert, Lael. p. 48, on sic habetote] 467
doloris is the acc. plur.: it is certain that doloris laboris maioris and the
like were often, if not generally, written by Lucr. and Virgil: see 509
melioris and v 591, and &Vagner orthogr. Verg. p. 404 : creant doloris:

478—521: hence it appears that the number of different shapes
in atoms is finite: some atoms must be infinitely large, if you have an
infinite variety of shapes 3 for say certain atoms consist of three parts or
four parts : their permutations will only give a certain number of shapes3
go on increasing the number of parts, the shapes after every change of
position will still be only finite in number: hence to get an infinite num-
ber of shapes, some atoms must be infinitely large, which is impossible:
again were the shapes infinite, what is now best in colour smell flavour
sound would be far surpassed3 as well as what is worst: but as it is
there is a limit to all this 3 there is a limit too to the heat and cold of
the year.—This was another point in which Epicurus differed from
Democritus and Leucippus who according to Arist. de gen. et corr. 1 1
p. 314 a 22 taught that ‘cheir atoms ἄπειρα καὶ τὸ πλῆθος εἶναι καὶ τας
μορφάς; p. 315 b 9 foll. he gives their reasons for this. Philoponus in
his comment p. 3 b on the words of Aristotle just quoted records that
according to Alexander of Aphrodisias the epicureans on this point
οὐκέτι συνεφώνησαν Δημοκρίτῳῑ this Epicurus himself in Diog. X 42 dis-
tinctly confirms, καὶ καθ’ ἑκάστην δὲ σχημάτισιν ἅπλῶς ἄπειροί εἰσιν
ἄτομοι, ταῖς δὲ διαφοραῖς οὐκ ἁπλῶς ἄπειροι ἀλλὰ μόνον οἷπερίληπτοιε
the number of shapes is not infinite, only inconceivably great : this care-
ful limitation is added no doubt with reference to Democritus. Lucr.
simply states and argues that the number is finite, without deciding
whether it is large or small. 479 Em hoc cet: it derives its proof
from what has been said, because though there is so much difference in
things in regard to hardness softness, smoothness roughness, and the like,
yet these differe-noes are only finite ε sce 500 foll. 480 1 514 finitis

of any single atom ' ; because his argument obliges him to begin with ‘the
