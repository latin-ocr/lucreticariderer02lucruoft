22 BOOK I NOTES II

κρατύνειςε the 1ast clause is parallel with 21 Quae quoniam etc. But
both Eurip. and Lucr. seem indebted to the Homeric hymn 1v 1 Ἀφρο-
δίτης Κύπριδος ἥτε θεοῖσιν ἐπὶ γλυκὺν ἵμερον ὦρσε Καί τ’ ἐδαμάσσατο φῦλα

ρος πολλοὶ τρέφει ἧδ’ ὅσα πόντος-ε the orphic hymn LV 4 follows in the
same track, Πάντα γοὶρ ἐκ σέθεν ἐστὶν ὖπεζεύξω δέ τε κόσμον· Καὶ
κρατέεις τρισσῶν μοιρῶν, γεννᾷς δὲ τοὶ πάντα ’Όσσα τ’ ἐν οὐρανῷ ἐστὶ καὶ ἐν

had attentively studied this translation, as we have said above and shall
often have occasion to repeat. 3 terras: Lucr. when speaking of the
earth as an extended surface or a solid mass uses the plur. of the accus.
and abl. oftener than the sing, the gen. not unfrequently, the nomin.
and dat. only once each I think, 11 1109 and v 630. fruyis'erentis
appears to be a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. 4 Concelebras rightly explained by
Wak. ‘ uno tempore frequentas, permeas': its first meaning seems to be
that of a multitude filling, crowding a place, as 11 344 variae volucres
laetantia quae loca aquaram Concelebrant...Et qzlae pervolyant nemora
avia pervolitantes, where Concelebrant and pervolqant might clearly
change places: comp. also Cic. de imp. On. Pomp. 61 At eam quoque
rem populns Romanus non modo vidit, secl omnium etiam studio visendam
et concelebrandam putavit: the goddess therefore fills at once with her
presence, pervolyat, earth and sea, and thus performs the part of a
multitude ε this sense is therefore more poetical than, and alsoimplies,
that of peopling. 5 lumina solis: in the nom. and acc. the plur.
is much oftener used than the sing. by Lucr. to express the φάος ἠελίοιο;
it occurs more than once in Ovid. 6 Te, after the vocatives and
re1atives of the first five vss„ follows as in Hor. od. 1 35 4 3 Catull. 2 9:

to nature and to the tongue, followed by a gen.; and in a pass. sense to
poems and to statues. 8 Summittit a favourite word of Lucr. in this
signification. rident here, as 11 559 ridet placidi pellacia ponti and V
1005 ridentibus undis, has simply the sense of nitet diffuso lumine in 9,
and rident in 111 22: there seems to be no reference to that plashing
ringing ripple so often seen on Greek and Italian seas in spring which
