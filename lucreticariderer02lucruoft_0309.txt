are supposed to laugh and cry. My correction then seems simple enough,
as sene would almost infallibly fall out before senescere: cumque is then a
s'enseless interpolation to fill up the verse: so in Hor. od. 1 32 15 cumque
is a mere insertion, the genuine word (conica orfizusta having fallen out.
I cannot accept Lachmann’s much praised meclicumque3 for milti is
called for by the whole tenor of the context, and rite vocanti requires
such a word asfausta or amica: possibly too in Lucr. 11 114 cumque is
an interpolation. [I see that Autem-ioth die conj. quom p. 285 c

Lucretius] The poet, observing what he would cleem the many foolish

318—323: if as some say the all-environing ether begets all things
and takes them back at death, then must it be mortal3 for it is thus
subject to increase and decrease.—This passage is an argumentum ad
hominem: the notion pleases his poetical fancy, and he has already more
than once seized on the thought and given to it an epicurean turn 3 see
what has been said at 1 250, and especially 11 991 foll. which has much
resemblance to this, caelesti sumus omnes semine oriundi, and 1000 quod
missumst ex aetheris oris cet.: the consciousness of this prevents him
from giving a denial to the theory here 3 and he contents himself with
leaving it as hypothetical τ si procreat cet. in which there is doubtless
irony mixed. The passage is a paraphrase of Pacuvius 86 Hoc vide,
circum supraque quod com plez-u continet Terram...IcZ quod nostri caelum
memorant, Ἀ Grai perh ibent aethera .· Quidquid est lioc, omnia animat
format alit auyet creat Sepelit recipitque in sese omnia, omniumque idem
est pater, [ndidemque eadem aeque oriuntur de integsro atque eodem occi-
dunt. 320 quidam therefore are Pacuvius and whoever they are
whom he follows, be they stoics or scholars of Plato or Pythagoras
or Anaxagoras or whoever else chooses to allegorise in a like spirit.
Pacuvius himself was probably thinking of Zeno: he says 93 Mater est
terra: ea parit corpus, animam aether adiuqat. 323 Deminui‚ recre-
ari, and thereby to be mortal: 111 517 At neque transferri sibi partis nec
