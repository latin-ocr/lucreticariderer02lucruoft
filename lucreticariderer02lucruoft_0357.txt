lakes quotes21370-1378 and says of them ‘Lucretius has charmingly
described a scene of this kind’. The description is likewise eminently
true of Italy, and is singularly graphio and coinpressed.

1379—1435 : birds taught men song 3 from the whistling of the
zephyr through reeds they learnt to blow through stalks3 next the pipe
came into use, with which they amused themselves mid other kinds of
rustic jollity 3 with such music watchers would while away the time, and
derive no less pleasure than now is gotten from elaborate tunes: then
acorns skins and beds of leaves were given up 3 though fought for once
as eagerly as men now strive for purple and gold 3 lust of gain and cares
ι came next to vex life. 1380 levia: Quintil. inst. 11 5 9 quae levis et
quadrata, sed virilis tamen compositio 3 v 12 18 he shews whence the

the meaning of dia here is not easy to determine3 see n. to 1. 22 dias in

which you find for instance at the present time in passing on a fine day
over the higher table-lands of Arcadia, so eminently now as always loca
pastorum desertaZ or is it otia sub divo, if indeed dia can bear that
meaning? dia may indeed have much the same sense as divinus in Aen.
