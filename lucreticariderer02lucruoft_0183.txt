alone of good writers. 1126 dispescat see notes 1: it must agree with

xv 15 Plautus in milite qlorioso (360) a littera in e mutata per compositi
vocabuli morem dispessis dicit cet. 1127 vescitur is quite suitable
here: eatS, i.e. takes in as food. 1129 manus dandum est: see n. to

Oowfuqient in 111 765. 1133 res amplior...et latior, with reference to
1126 dispessa: for involved arrangement of words see n. to 111 843.
1135 modo has reference, as Lach. says, to auqmioze adempto; but modo
used of present or future time is rare : see Forc. who quotes Ter. ad. 289
modo dolores, mea tu, occipiunt primulum, and the remark of Donatus

writes consacravi. 1137 proquam: 111 199 parvissima corpora pro-
quam...ita; VI 11 proquam posset : the word seems not to be found out
of Lucr.: Lach. to VI 11 ‘aeque Latina sunt pro ut, prae ut, pro quam,
prae quam, neque ab his differunt praeter quam, post quam, aute quam,
super quam'. 1138 tantum answers to proquam, as 111 200 ita.
1139 cibus, cibus, cibus may be compared with the instances given in n.
