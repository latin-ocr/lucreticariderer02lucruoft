alike. But other rules observed with equal care by Virgil and Catullus
are repeatedly and intentionally neglected by Lucretius. Thus we find
in him hundreds of instances in which the first two feet are marked off
from the rest of the verse in the following unusual modes taken at
random from his six books: with two dactyls at the beginning Reliqioni-
bus atque minis, Omnia denique sancta, Suscipiendaque curarit, Quippe
patentia cum, Vertice Palladis ad templum: with a spondee and dactyl
Erqo vivida vis, At primordia qiqnundis‚ Praetermittere et humanis,
Aut eoetrinsecus ut: more rarely a dactyl and spondee or two spondeeS‚
but then a monosyllable must follow, Sive voluptas est, Non temere ulla
vi 3 Inmortali sunt, Nam cum multo sunt, Vis est, quarum nos: once
indeed with great boldness, but with singularly happy effect, 111 527
Et membratim vitalem deperdere sensum. Instances of such rhythms in
Virgil may be counted on the fingers 2 he has Scilicet omnibus est labor
inpendendus, Armentarius Afer, Sed tu desine velle, Sparqens umida
mella, probably in imitation of Lucretius 3 and Per conubia nostra after
Catullus' Sed conubia laeta, with him too a mere exceptional rhythxn for
a peculiar effect. In Cicero's early work the Aratea similar instanoes
are found, Verum tempora sunt, Inclinatior atqae3 but they are rarer
than in Lucretius: in the 80 or 90 verses still remaining of his poeni de
consulatu suo written about five years before the death of our poet
there is not a single example. In the middle of the verse too Lucretius
has many favourite movements, most of which are not unexampled in
Virgil Catullus 01· Cicero but are much less common, such as Quid
nequeat finita potestas, Detulit ex Helicone perenni, Amnibus inveniuntur
aperto, Finita variare fiqurarum ratione, Omne qenus perfusa colori-
bus, Pocula crebra unquenta, and a hundred such. Cicero has some
pretty verses in his prognostica which suggest the manner of Lucretius,
Vos quoque siqna videtis, aquai dulcis alumnae, Cum clamore paratis
inanis fundere voces, Absurdoque sono fontis et stayna cietis...vocibus
instat, Vocibus instat et adsiduas iacit ore querellas: the latter passage
Lucretius V 298 has manifestly imitated. In the fifth and sixth feet of
the verse too, so important for the rhythm, the manner of Lucretius is
much more like that of Ennius and, in some points, of the Greeks, than
that of Virgil or Catullus or even Cicero: he delights to close the verse
with such words as principiorum materiai simplicitate, or vis animai,
saecla animantum, mente animoque, and does not even avoid such harsh
elisions as quandoquidem emtat, perpetuo aevo, praeterea usquam. Now
in Virgil such endings as quadrupedantum ancipitemque, and in Catullus
such a one as eqredientem are exceedingly uncommon. But these poets
make one striking exception in favour of Greek words and dclight to
close a verse with hymenaeus Deiopea Thersilochumque and the like:
a concession to Greek rhythm and a prettiness which Lucretius would
not care for. As for the other rhythms just mentioned, Virgil says
