as in Lucr., both cases are found together: ‘Plane Men. 1089 Neque

old negative; see n. to 11 23. 1220 Propterea cet: Aristotle, who
discusses these very questions de gen. anim. 1v 3 p. 769 1 foll„ finds
then all more difficult to answer than Lucr. does: so l. 1. 24 διὰ τίν’
αἰτίαν ἐοικὸς ’γίνεται τοῖς προγόνοις ὠς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ καὶ τοῖς ἄποθεν 3 οὔ γὰρ

(1226) must come in the order here given 3 for surely voltus vocesque
comasque are comprehended in facies et corpora membraque; and if thoy
were not, what reason could there be for the poet's asserting that they
are as uncertain in their origin, 88 the body generally? just 88 if any
body were likely to think that the less essential were more unvarying
than the more essential : this indeed induced Lamb. to read minus for
mayis. Again, as Lach. says himself, de semiue certo is here aut virili
aut muliebri, one not both, and is opposed to 1229 duplici de semiue,
and forms a contrast with it: 1225 (1227) 111 fact begins a new question,
which Arist. 1. l. thinks it not easy to explaing why namely a male
child may be more like the mother, 8 female like the father. 1225

1227 baec, i.e. the distinctions of sex no more come certo semine, from
either the father's or the mother's alone, than the form and features:
Hippocr. l. 1. emphatically asserts the same: thus 7 οὗτος 0‘ λόγος αἱρέει
καὶ τὸν ἄνδρα καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα ἔχειν καὶ θῆλυν γόνον καὶ ἄρσενα, and 8 at end
καὶ ταῦτά μοι καὶ τοσαῦτά ἐστι ἱστόρια τῷ προτέρῳ λόγῳ, ὅτι ἔνεστι καὶ ἐν τῇ
γυναικὶ καὶ ἐν τῷ οἷνὸρὶ καὶ κουρογονίη καὶ θηλυγονίηε comp. this with
Aristotle’s doubts and difficulties. 1231 possis: 888 11. to 1 327.

1232 virum suboles would commonly mean the whole male sex 3 so in
Cio. omnem iuventutis subolem=omnem iuventutem 3 proles illa futu-
rorum ltominum2fut1u=i homines, and Virgil has prolem parentum for
the stock to which the parents belong 3 Pliny Sarmatae Medorum suboles,
of the same stock as the Medes3 Ov. fasti 1 449 volucrum proles; Lucr.

procudere saecla, their race; and 111 741 triste leonum seminiumztristes
leones, where 888 note 3 1v 998 catulorum blanda propayo: catuli blandi.
But here virum suboles means one out of the male sex 3 what Livy 1 1 11

liberum, ex maqrta proyeuie liberorum, all within a few chapters in XLV.
