62—79: human life lay prostrate beneath religion, until a man of
Greece rose up, explained the true system of the universe, and trampled
on religion in turn. 62 ante oeulos, plain for all to see : often used
by Lucr. in cognate meaning-s, as 342 and 984 (998) for what is
visible to sense: [Sen. rhet. controv, I 1 16 stare ante oculos Fortuna
videbatur] 63 religyione, with one l: so the best mss. of other authors
also: relligy. only once, v 114, in AB. 65 super often in Lucr. has
the sense of insuper or praeterea, never I think that of desuper: the
former may be its meaning here3 though that would be weak3 I
take it therefore as in 39 circumfusa super ‘being above him’, and Aen.
IX 168 Haec super e vallo prospectant Troes, ‘the Trojans being above
look forth etc.': so here ‘standing over mortals being herself above’. I
doubt whether in Virgil it ever bears the sense of desuper: in Aen.
V 697 I take it to mean insuper : yet there is no question that superne,
a favourite word with Lucr.‚ sometimes has the force of desuper 3 and
the two meanings are often not easy to discriminate. 66 Graius
homo, as Enn. ann. 1833 and Virg. Aen. x 7 20 who imitates probably
both Ennius and Lucr.: Ennius twice uses in the same way Romanus

non Piraeeum. toll. con. oa: Livy VI 16 3 nec adversus dictatoriam

the end of this and the next verse are of course in intentional apposition,

x 24 17 ad famam populi Romani pertinere 3 Aen. VIII 731 Attollens
umero famamque et fata nepotum 3 Heyne and Conington seem to me
rightly to explain in the sanie way Aen. Iv 218 famamque fovemus
inanem: thus Epicurus proved the fama deum to be inanis, full of
sound signifying nothing. Indeed an epithet to fama would to my mind
impair, not increase the force of the expression. '70 Inritat perfi: so
VI 587 Disturbat urbes, and v 396 superat et which seems a certain conj.
of Lach. : in each case the -at is followed by a vowel 3 but on this point
