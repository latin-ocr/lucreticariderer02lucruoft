BOOK ΙΙ NOTES II 165

quite fails to apprehend the poet’s meaning, when he reads here Prop-
terea. dolor, and therefore sense3 pain in any thing that has sense is
only a disordering of its elements. 966 voluptas, and therefore sense.
967 Scire cet: therefore pleasure and pain being but the right or wrong
ordering of elements, the elements themselves which are each one and
indivisible‚ are formed of no elements which can be moved, so as to give
pleasure or pain3 and therefore they have no sense. 969 non sunt θα)
ullis cet. i.e. ipsa non constant ex ullis principiis: Lachmann’s punctua-
tion of this v. and explanation of the whole passage is to me quite
incomprehensible 3 he must have quite misunderstood both sense and con-
struction here. sunt ex: 1 61 eac illis sunt omnia primis 3 11 458 siminus

Zonya et brevi et lonya..Nam (paean) aut e lonqa est et tribus brevibus

iambus quidem, qui est e brevi et Zonya...azct etiam dactylus qui est e
lonqa et duabus brevibus. 970 quorum cet. i.e. ut dolorem capiant
novitate motus eorum; see n. to v 873 quare. motus is of course the
gen. 972 Haut {quitur cet. because pain and pleasure are sense. The
argument may really be a begging of the question, but is perfectly
intelligible: these vss. too, 963-972‚ clearly form a new paragraph
quite distinct from the former: we might compare with them the famous
saying of Hippocrates de nat. hom. 2 ἐγώ δέ φημι, εἷ ἓν ἣν ἅνθρωπος,
οῧὸέποτ’ ἂν ἤλγεε· οὐδὲ γοῖρ ἂν ἦν ὑφ’ ὅτου ἀλγήσειε ἓν ἐών.

973—990: if sense must be given to the elements of living things in
order that these things may have sense, then must their elements have
the same feelings and reasoning powers which men have3 they will thus
have to consist of other elements, and these again of others on to in—
finity: if all this is absurd, and you cannot conceive laughing or think-
ing atoms, why not allow generally things that have sense to come from
elements without sense‘l—See what is said on 1 919 920: Mr Poste
observes that, as among the ὁμοιομερῆ Aristotle‚ and prob. Anaxagoras,
included the sensories, this may account for Lucr. introducing the subJect
a second time, when he is treating, as here, of the sensories. 974 si
iam: see n. to 1 968. 975 propritim, another ἅπαξ λεγόμ.; on these
adverbs see n. to 1 20 yeneracim3 but the form is curicus, as analogy
would lead us to expect a form proprietas. The argument is, if sense
generally must come from sense, then the special sense of man should
come from elements specially endowed with similar sense, the power of
laughing, crying, thinking. In this paragraph Lucr.‚ as his wont is,
clinches so to speak his refutation of the doctrine that sense must come
from sentient elements, by a sarcastic appeal to common sense. 976
977 comp. 1 919 920, in substance the same. 976—984 Mr Poste
says ‘the answer to the query would be very easy on the theory of
Anaxagoras: he held the divisibility of matter including τὸ ὁμοιομερές
