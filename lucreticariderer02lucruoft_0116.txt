Locke essay 11 13 21 seeks to prove space infinite : he asks ‘ whether if
god placed a man at the extremity of corporea] beings, he could. not
stretch his hand beyond his body: if he could, then he would put
his arm where there was before space without body...if he could not
stretch out his hand, it must be because of some external hindrance
...and then I ask whether that which hinders his hand from moving
onwards be substance or accident, something or nothing'.

984 (998)-98'7 (1001) ι 110 concludes his argument on the omne
with a short statement taken from what comes under the sight of all:
comp. what is said above on 701 foll. 759 foll. 915 foll.: comp. also 11
471—477, 111 367-369, v 506-508, 556-563, 646—649. That these
vss. should be placed here admits I think of no question: they utterly
destroy the sequence of the reasoning, where they come in mss. For a
probable explanation of why they got out of place see vol. 1 p. 29 : ignor-
ance of the different stages of the argument would suggest that Postremo
must follow Praeterea of 988 ; and therefore the first editor would not
unnaturally give to this addition of the poet‘s the place it has in all mss.
All finite things bound and are bounded by something discontinuous and
distinct in kind: comp. the stoic Cleomedes de meteor. 1 6 at end πᾶν

988 (984)-1007 : but space or void is likewise infinite3 else matter
during past eternity must have sunk in a mass to the bottom, and no-
thing could exist: but as space is infinite on all hands, there is no lowest
point to which first-beginnings can tend : they have boundless room to
move in for ever.—Having shewn the omne to be infinite, he now pro-
ceeds to decide one of the two questions mooted above 953 foll. and to
prove space to be infinite. 988 summai totius is another name for
the omne. 991 cmfflucret: see n. to 233. 992 3αό caeli teymine

inherent motion both Epic. and Lucr. conceived as a motion downwards
with reference to our world : comp. in fact what he has said a few lines
before 3 and see the acute remarks in the N. British Review p. 222,
‘ gravitation in its apparent action seemed to shew a universal tendency
in one direction3 this then he claimed as an inherent property of hi's
