Epic. l. 1. 94 reasons in just the same way, κενώσεις τε σελήνης καὶ πάλιν

μένοι. The reasoning is quite the same as in the preceding sections:
any of these theories may be true, and as none can be proved not to be
true, none being opposed to sense, all are equally true 5 any one therefore
μαχόμενος τοῖς ἐναργήμασιν οὐδέποτε δυνήσεται ἀταραξίας γνησίου μεταλα-
βεῖν; the attainment of this α’ταραξία γνήσιος being the end Epicurus and
Lucretius had before them in writing their physics, and not the vain
ambition to propagate idle mathematical and other theories. '70¹7 and
724 Ad speciem :ad visum: see n. to lv 236. '708 pleno bene: this
use of bene is a favourite one with Cicero. '712 siynorum per orbem:
see n. to 691 siqnfferi orbis. Lucr. here gives a lucid statement of the
true cause. 714 cursus viam: 1124 iter viai and 11 626 iter omne
viarum seem not unlike: Vitruvius 1x 2 1 (4 17) cursum itineris sui
peraqens. '715 Est quare possit -- est ut possit, so common in Lucr.:
see n. to 1 620 Nil erit ul distet: it means therefore simply potest 3 and is
not used as 7 30 sit cur, where cur has its usual meaning; it has in fact
much the same force as qua re in 11 960, and should perhaps be written
as two words 3 see also n. to vl 132. Plut. de plac. phil. 11 28 mentions
Anaximander and Antiphon as holding that the moon shone with its
own light; but who hit upon this notion of the parasitica] opaque body
in order to explain its phases, Ι don't know. The observant Thales
taught that its light was derived from the sun.

'720 siforte = fortasse, εἰ τύχοι, and used parenthetically, is found in
Cicero, as de orat. 111 473 de off. 11 703 pro Mil. 1045 ad Att. xlv 13 2;
acl Q. frat. 1 2 ’ἴε see Madvig emend. Liv. p. 123: it serves there-
fore here as a connecting particle in passing to a new hypothesis,
and is the same as Est etiam ut versari possit, ut ylobus cet. '723 ewm
partem i.e. the dimidiam partem just mentioned. ¹726 ylo‘mera-
minis atque pilai seems a hendiadys for the ylobus pilai of 720.
72¹7 Babyl. Chald. doct: he speaks of the theory of Berosus, of which
Vitruv. 1x 2 (4) gives a full account: I will quote the beginning,
Berosus qui a Chaldaeorum civitate sive ‘natione proyressus in Asia
etiam disciplinam Chaldaicam patefecit, ita εει professus, pilam esse
ex dimidia parte candentem, reliqua habere caerulco colore. cum autem
cursum itineris sui perayens subiret sub orbem solis, tunc eam ‘radiis
