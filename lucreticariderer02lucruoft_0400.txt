the black death, erysipelas, smallpox, the oriental plague, some wholly
extinct form of disease: each succeeding writer at least throws doubts
on his predecessors’ diagnosis. Lucretius' copy must manifestly be even
more vague and inconclusive. The t'ruth is that having laid down his
general principles of disease and vindicated his philosophy, he seeks now
to satisfy his poetical feeling by a powerful and pathetical description
which he has plainly left in an unfinished state. He has been imitated
in turn by Virgil geor. 111 47 8—566, closely by Ovid met. vn 523—613,
by Seneca Oed. llo—201, by Livy more than once, and by others.
1138 φηονέρβεν aestus has no reference I think to Ilaec: Haec ratio is
the law of diseases just mentioned, which at this time caused a mortifer
aestus, so that Lachmann⁷s objection ‘quis enim has res diversissimas
coniungat, baec ratio et mortifer aestus morborum' has no force: in fact
the v. is a paraphrase of 1098 eu vis omnis morborum pestilitasque 3 comp.
too 1090 ratio quae sit morbis cet: and for the expression 830 vis baec
atque aestus Averni. The first words of Virgil's description Hic quondam
morbo are evidently suggested by Lucr. and it is not unlikely that the
(cestu of 47 9, used in a different sense, is a reminiscence of our aestus 3 and
it is nearly certain that Ovid 1. l. 529 et iymwos rinclusit nubibus aestus
comes from Lucr. when we recollect the mode in which he makes pesti-
lence approach, 1099 ut nubes nebulaeque, 1121 Ut nebula ac nubes. aestus
has essentially the same force as in 1049, 1051, 1056, and elsewhere,
i.e. a copious emanation of particles: (lirae 23 Mutant pestiferos aestus.

strange atmosphere of Egypt put itself in motion, travelled gradually
over much sea and air and at last arrived at Athens: Thuc. says no such
thing: with his usual caution he tells us that it began, ὥς λέγεται, 111
Aethiopia, and descended to Egypt and Persia 3 and suddenly broke out
in Athens beginning with the Piraeus 3 so that it is possible a ship
carried it direct from Egypt. 1141 veniens, ortus, permensus: see
