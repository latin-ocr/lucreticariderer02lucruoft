To NOTEs 11 7

appear to be finished and to have received almost the last touches of the
author with the exception perhaps of certain portions of the second,
pointed out in their several places. The greater part of these books is
devoted to a very complete and systematical account of the natures and
properties which belong to the two great constituents of the universe,
atoms and. void. Given to him this universe in working order there is
much that is striking, much even that may be true, much at all events
that N ewton accepted, in this description3 something too in which he
was in advance even of the age of N ewton. We of course care, not for
its scientific value or truth, but for its poetical grandeur and efficacy
upon our imaginations 3 and in these respects we are most amply satisfied.
The least interesting portions of these books are perhaps the episodes in
which the rival systems of Heraclitus Empedocles and Anaxagoras are
examined and refuted. They are closely connected with the general
subject and the poet is much in earnest, but, as was indeed to be
expected and as is pointed out in the proper place, he could only criticise
them from his own point of view and starting from his own principles.
The third book is likewise tolerably finished 3 and in no portion of his
work does he more fully display his power of sustained and systematical
reasoning. Here too, if his premisses are granted, his arguments are
striking and effective, and carried through with the energy of a fanatica]
conviction. The poetry and pathos and earnest satire of the last 260
verses are of a very high order. The fourth book is in a much less complete
condition than those which precede. Yet in the first part of it, in which
the epicurean theory of images is expounded, he wrestles with its
gigantic difficulties and often overcomes them with singular power energy
and controversial address. And in truth the most obvious objections to
this doctrine of images apply almost as strongly to the N ewtonian theory
of the emission of light which in spite of them so long maintained its
ground. The later sections of the book, which explain the operations
of the other senses, the way in which the mind and the will are excited,
the theories of food, walldng, sleep and the like, are more sketchy and
unfinished, though they often shew acute observation. The concluding
two hundred verses are very peculiar and display a satirical vein as
powerful and much more subtle than that of Juvenal. The fifth book is
also unequal: some few lines, pointed out in their place, are almost
unworthy of the poet and seem to have been. written down to fill up a
gap until he found time to change them for better. The portions too in
which he describes the movements of the sun and moon and stars will
not afford any great gratification. But more than half the book, nauiely
416-508 and 771 to the end, are in his noblest manner. Nothing in
Latin poetry surpasses, if it even equals these verses, in grandeur sub-
limity and varied beauty: occasionally too some fine touches of earnest
satire are met with: in these passages, as well as in those mentioned
