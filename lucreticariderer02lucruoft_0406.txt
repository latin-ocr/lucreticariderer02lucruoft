animam, potitus est yloriam 3 [Plaut. asin. 604 tibi te vitam esse amissu-
rum, and see Ussing’s references there] respectans, as v 975 taciti re-
spectabant. 1235 Quippe etenim cet: what is the meaning of these con-
junctions? the poet has just been saying that the most piteous thing of all
was to see how those who caught the disease at once lost heart, gave
themselves over, and made no effort for life: he then goes on to say ‘for
they at no time ceased to catch the infection' and so on. Why this for?
how can the fear of danger of infection add to the grief and despair of those
who are already stricken? both in these vss. and in what precedes and
follows the poet is treading closely on the steps of the historian: now read
the words he is here translating: 51 6 δεινότατον δὲ παντὸς ἦν τοῦ κακοῦ ἥ
τε οἷθυμία (πρὸς γὰρ τὸ ἀνέλπιστον εῧθύς τραπόμενοι τῇ γνώμῃ πολλῷ μᾶλλον
προΐεντο σφᾶς αὐτοὺς καὶ οὐκ οἷντεῖχον), καὶ ὅτι ἕτερος ἀφ’ ἑτέρου θεραπείας

το ἐνεποίειε that is to say, the most fearful feature of the plague was this,
on the one hand the despondency and utter mental prostratim] of those
who were attacked, on the other hand the great danger of contagion
which scared away or else struck down the healthy, ἥ τε ἀθυμία and καὶ
{sn both of course being subjects of δεινότατον ἧνε now is it not plain that
Lucr. has carelessly made καὶ ὅτι depend on what immediately precedeS,
and has not referred it back to δεινότατον ἧνῖῑ and hence the strange
paralogism involved in his Quippe etenim. apisci: this seems a not
unnatural, but yet unusual application of the word: Plautus however in
his epitaph has mortem aptus est. 1238 cum. scm. fam: see n. to 111

Act stabulum. But here too the argument is strange: ‘this above all
heaped death upon death3 for those who refused to attend their own
sick, killing neglect soon after would punish for their too great love of
life and fear of death by a foul and evil end, left to themselves without
help': he then adds naturally enough that they who did stay, caught
the infection and died. He is here following closely the order of Thuc.
who continues εἴτε γὰρ μή θέλοιεν δεδιότες οἶλλήλοις προσιέναι, ἀπώλλυντο
ἕρημοιε but instead of making οἱ πάσχοντες nom. of ἀπώλλυντο, he took
οἱ δεδιότες προσιέναι for its subject3 and feeling the weakness of the

argument he has tricked it out with these embellishments, and given >

three lines to express the two words of Thuc. The edueated Romans
of Lucretius’ time had an exquisite knowledge of their own tongue‚ its
syntax, its grammar, its prosody‚ all its refinelnents and capabilities3
they were also well acquainted with Greek, such as Greek then was 3 but
the Attic of Thucydides and SophocleS‚ of Plato and Demosthenes had
been dead for centuries3 and Greek had become the lingua franca of the
civilised world. 1240 mortis timentis: I find no other instance of this
