‘this proposition foreshadows the doctrine of conservation of energy. It
is coupled with the assertion that the sum of matter was never denser or
rarer than it now is, a proposition which we may admit in the sense that
the mean density of the universe is constant...It is clear in all his work
that Lucr. conceived two things as quite constant: atoms were neither
created nor destroyed, and their motion could neither be created nor
destroyed. He believed that each atom kept its velocity unaltered. The
modern doctrine is that the total energy of the universe is constant,
but may be variously distributed, and is possibly due to motion alone
ultimately, though this last point has not been proved '. The amount
of motion in the παλμός 01· oscillation of the atoms forming a lump of
iron or of granite is precisely the same as that of the motion of these
same atoms racing alone down space.

308—332 : though atoms are in constant motion, yet the whole uni-
verse appears to be at rest, because they are far beneath the ken of our
senses: nay visible things often when seen from a distance seem to be at
rest 3 as a flock of sheep feeding 3 or as an army of foot and horse, if
looked down upon from a height. 309 sintin motu: an unusual
rhythm 3 but in motu is to be taken metrically as one word 3 so always
inter se, inter nos and the like. 310 Summa...summa: the play on
words which he so loves. 311 dat motus=movetur z see n. to 1 819 :
either the sun or moon or the clouds or any thing moving on the earth
is an instance of such partial motion. 312 infra is here the adv. :

to 41. 324 foll. Lucr. had more than one passage of Homer in his
mind: Od. ξ 267 πλῆτο δὲ πᾶν πεδίον πεζῶν τε καὶ ἵππων Χαλκοῦ τε στερο-
πῆς, Il. T 362 Αἴγλη δ’ οὐρανόν ἷκε, γέλασσε δὲ πᾶσα περὶ χθών Χαλκοῦ

326 Aere rem: Virg. geor. 11 281 fluctuat omnis Aere renidenti tellus.
supter appears to be an adv.3 for it would be harsh to join it with pedi-
bus3 and so I presume Lucr. understood ὑπό in Il. B 465 and T 363.
