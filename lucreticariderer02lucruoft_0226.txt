and orave. 906 cinefactum: Lach. assails Nonius for explaining it
‘in cinerem dissolutum’: after the analogy he says of tumefacere rube-
facere and the like it must be connected with a supposed neut. verb
cinere: prope must be joined with it: so prope cinef. means ‘qui iam
prope cineris colorem et adspectum nanctus est’. He thus in his short
enigmatical way implies that bustum here is not the pyre, but the tomb
in which the body was laid entire and gradually assumed from time the
hue of ashes, horrifico busto Ι have no doubt means the funeral-pile:
Aen. XI 200 Ardentis spectant socios semustaque servam Bueta ‘neque
avelli possunt ; Paulus Festi p. 32 ‘bustum proprie dicitur locus in quo
mortuus est combustus et sepultus': and if cinefactum cannot have the
meaning given to it by Nonius, it must imply that the friends looked on
and wept while the body was caught by the flames and gradually changed
its natural colour for that given to it by the scorchingof the fire. This
is perhaps more poetical than the meaning assigned to it by Nonius,
though it is bold in such a case to speak dogmatically like Lach. 3 but it
spoils the fine passage to join‚ as he does, prope with cinef: with the use
of prope here comp. vl 403 prope ut hinc teli determinet ictus. 90¹7

hoc: here, as 900, with poetical indirectness he tells who is the speaker
of 904—908: probably the son or nearest relation is singled out. 911
Cur quisquam aeterno cet. with reference to 907 aeternumque Nulla dies

912—930: men say glass in hand ‘enjoy the moment, it cannot
be recalled' 3 as if after death one felt the want of wine or aught
else: in sleep we have no thought for life 3 how much less then in
death if there can be a less than nothing! for death is a more com-
plete dispersion of our matter, a sleep that knows no waking. 912
foll. Martha p. 159 foll. well contrasts the sternness of Lucretian with
the frivolity of Horatian epicureanism : the ‘carpe diem' and the like.
