whom Lucr. here mainly attacks, though the peripatetics and some others
held a similar doctrine: they taught that there was but one finite world
surrounded by an infinite void 3 and that the world was upheld in the
way which Lucr. so clearly explains here, by things pressing to the
centre: the carth resting ἰσοκρατῶς in the words of Zeno in Stob. ecl. 1
19 4, at about the centre of the κόσμος, in the same way that the whole
finite κόσμος remains fast in the infinite void. Had Epicurus, while
retaining his conceptions of infinite space and matter and innumerable
worlds and systems, seen fit to adopt this stoical doctrine of things
tending to a centre, and so to make his atonis rush from all sides of space
alike towards a centre, he might have anticipated the doctrine of uni-
versal gravity: see what is said at 11 251 foll. But Lucr. is right in
rejecting the absurd reasons which the stoics gave for things pressing
to the centre of one finite world in the midst of infinite void, and he
well exposes here, 1083—1113, and 11 184-215, their inconsistency in

making some things seek, others fly from the centre. 1052 fuye with
an infin. is found in Virgil Horace Ovid and Tibullus: Lucr. has an infin.
after suyito too more than once: see n. to 658. 1053 quod dicunt:

id quod dicunt, or ut dicunt : so quod (lico, 1080 sua quod natura petit, 11
369 quod natura reposcit, and the like: Lach. seems to me only to involve
the constr. 1055 ictibus eaet. of atoms: see 1042 and 1050. 1056
the stoic in Cic. de nat. deor. 11 115 says omnes partes eius undique
medium locum capessentes nituntur aequaliter cet. and Zeno himself in
Stob. ecl. l. l. πάντα ‘td μέρη τοῦ κόσμου ἐπὶ vd μέσον τοῦ κόσμου τήν φορσῘν
ἔχειν, μάλιστα δὲ τοὶ βάρος ἔχοντα. 1057 is parenthetical: Lach. rightly
compares the form of expr. in 1v 366 Aera si credis privatum lumine
posse Induqredi: comp. also 11 603 neque posse in terra sistere terram;
and Pliny 11 162 sic terrae, arcentibus cunctis, ‘nisi in se locus ‘non est.

1058 1059 Lach. and some older editors join these with 1057: this may
be right, but Ι prefer to connect them with 1056: Et [fuge credere] quae
pond. sunt cet. sunt: comp. 11 226 feruntur 3 v 630 abest, propinquat:
in the first two cases we might easily read sint and ferantur 3 but I
make no change, because the best writers often mix such indicative
clauses with the orat. obL: Caes. bell. Gall. v 11 4 Labieno scribit ut
quam plurimas posset iis Zeyionibus, quae sunt apud eum, ‘naves instituat3
and Sall. Iug. 54 1 hortatur ad cetera, quae levia sunt, parem animum
gerant, much resemble our passage : [Caes. b. civ. 1 87 1 iis qui amiserasnt
restituatur, where see Kramer's note] 1059 retro posta: if two men
are feet to feet, the one is supposed to be reversed or turned upside down,
just as your shadow in the water looks to be: Cic. acad. pr. 11 123 qui
adversis vestigiis stent contra nostra vestiyia‚ quos ἀντίποδας vocatis. 1060
unquestionably is joined with what precedes: see notes 1: Lach. here
labours in vain z Lucian Demon. 22 gives just the same illustration, φυσικόν
