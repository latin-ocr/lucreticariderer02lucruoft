BOOK II NOTES II 157

'75¹7 foll. with this and with what precedes and follows comp. what Plut.
adv. Oolot. 7 cites from the 2nd book of Epicurus against Theophrastus:
colours are not συμφυῆ τοῖς σώμασιν, ἀλλά γεννᾶσθαι κατσῖ ποιοῖς τινας
τάξεις καὶ θέσεις πρὸς τήν ὄψιν κ.τ.λ. 760-762 nearly: 1 817-819,
908-910, 11 1007—1009. '767 candenti marmore is abl. of quality:
with canos candenti comp. 771 candens et album, both mere pleonasms:
ciris 320 candentes canos 3 Catul. 64 14 candenti e quo'yite‚ 18 e yuryite
cano. '7'7'7 nitorem=colorem‚ as 782 787 and 819. '780 Convenie-
bat, after 776 Sin sunt: the tense always used by Lucr. in this sense:
another proof, if that were needed, that 111 685 Convenit cet. is spurious,
the right form Conveniebat having preceded in 682. 785 extra, 011 1110
outside, opposed to what is intus, seems quite to suit the meaning: comp.
Varro de re rust. 111 16 16 vitiles fimo bubulo oblinunt intus et extra 3
[Quintil. inst. orat. Ι 10 43 deni in quadram pedes, quadrayinta per
oram, intra centnm erunt :] comp. too Lucr. IV 646 Ut sunt dissimiles
extrinsecus.

788-794: we are tempted to give to atoms colour, not knowing how
colour otherwise can come: but we have seen that white can come from
what is not white3 and surely white 0011 01130 more easily from no
0010111, 111011 for instance from black: this reason then falls to the ground.
'789 causa, i.e. the vulgar notion that things with colour cannot come
from things without colour 3 which is easily understood from 730 foll.
'790 quoniam, as seen in the last paragraph. '791 cluentzsunt.
variis ex: see n. 10 1 841.

'795—816: again colours cannot exist without light, atoms never
come into the light, therefore atoms have no colour: what colour can
there be in darkness, when we 300 11101 1110 same thing continually
changes its colour in different lights? as therefore it is such and such
stroke of light which produces such and such colour, without that stroke
they cannot exist: as too one stroke produces white, another black, and
as a stroke is a touch, and as it 13 shape, not colour, which affects touch,
atonis need, not colour, but different shapes to give different touches.
'795 foll. Lucretius' syllogism is quite correct3 it is Lambinus' which is in
fault, who quite misstates the poet's minor premiss. '79'7 velata: a
picturesque metaphor. '799 quin ipso z quinetiam: see n. to 1 588.
802 cervices collumque, one of his many pleonasms3 as cervices means the
back, collum the whole circle of the neck: Cic. in Vatin. 4 inflato collo,
tumidis cervicibus 3 pro Sestio 90 et cervices et inquiam. 803 ‘the
pyropus was made by adding 6 scruples of gold, or one quarter, to the
ounce of copper' King on gems p. 116. But the pyrope was also a pre—
cious stone, a kind of garnet: ib. p. 53 3 and this meaning agrees perhaps
better with the curalium and zmarayclos of 805. Ovid. met. 11 2 flam-
masque imitante pyropo. 804 sensu refers to the beholder's perception
or mode of viewing it: 1v 448 quodam sensa fit uti videantur Omnia.
