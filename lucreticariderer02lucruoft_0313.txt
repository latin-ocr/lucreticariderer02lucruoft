416-431; Ι will now describe how the various parts of the world
were formed: as We said above, it was not by design that atoms framed
it; but after many fruitless collisions, they chanced to fall into such
motions as produced the world and all that is in it. 416 ille is
emphatic, as 11 362. 419—431, except only 427, are 611 found
elsewhere: 419—422 Nam—modis multis z 1 1021—1024: 422—426
multa modis—creare z V 187—191 : 428 ε 1 1026: 429—431 = with
slight difference 11 1061-1063 : we meet again here what we have met
already in this and former books: this passage which is the preface to
one of the grandest parts of the poem is itself ill—constructed and patched
up from various sources, shewing once more that the poem was left by
its author in an unfinished state and that he had carefully worked up
some portions, though he had not yet properly connected them with
the rest of the poem. 422 foll. comp. the epicure-an passage, taken
perhaps from Epicurus himself, in Plut. de plac. phil. 1 4 τῶν ἀτόμων
σωμάτων ἀπρονόητον Καὶ 'fuxo-[av ἐχόντων Τήν Κίνησίν συνεχῶς ΤΕ Καὶ Τᾶχιστα

ἔχοντα καὶ σχημάτων καὶ μεγεθῶν. 423 plaqis Ponderibusque, by the
joint action of which, as so fully shewn in 11, the first-beginnings are
able to come into collision and union. 430 saepe : in 11 semper: both
are equally appropriate; saepezon many other occasions and also
at the foundation of our world, Tem-ai maris cet.

432—448: then could be seen nothing that now is seen, sun 51615
earth sea 01· heaven, but a strange chaotic jumble of atoms unable to
combine: gradually the different parts of the world began to separate.
432 foll. comp. Emped. 72 ’Ἔνθ’ οὐδ’ ηἐλίοιο δεδίσκεται (2) ἀγλαὸν εἶδος
Οὐδὲ μὲν οὐδ’ αἴης λάσιον δέμας οὐδὲ θάλασσα. 432 solis rota: 564 Nec
nimio solis maior ‘rota nec minor ardor Esse potest shews the ‘rota to be
the orbis: many of the poets, beginning with Enn. ann. 548 patefeci&
radiis rota candida caelum, use the same phrase 3 see Fore: butVitruvius
