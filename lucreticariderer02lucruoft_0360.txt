help (coyei) giving vent to the bitterest complaints: for the contrast of
animus and corda comp. Plaut. aulul. 380 Postquam lianc rationem
ventri cordique eclicli, Accessit animus. 16 Pausa we have had already
five times. infestis has pretty nearly the force of saevis: they are
complainings expressing hatred and hostility towards nature and the
condition of things. 17 Intellegsit: the best mss. of Sallust have
intelleqit in Iug. 6 2, and intelleyerint in hist. 1 41 23: Cat. 51 24
Jordan on good authority gives neqleyeris ; and Iug. 40 1 neqleyisset.

infundis acescit. Here again stoic and epicurean meet: Gellius XVII 19
ἄνθρωπε, ποῦ βάλλεις3 σκέψαι εἰ κεκάθαρται τὸ ἀγγεῖον· ἂν γᾶρ εἷς τήν
οἴησιν αὐτὰ βάλλῃς, ἀπώλετο· ἦν σαπῇ, οὖρον ἢ ὅξος γένοιτο ἢ εἴτι τούτων
χεῖρον. nil projecto his verbis quirius, nil verius, quihus declarabat mami-
mus philosophorum (i.e. Epictetus) litteras atque doctrinas philosophiae,
cum in hominem, salsum atque ‹l125sene7·enz‚ tamquam in vas spurcum

foris and commoda are opposed to ill ius ‘citio corrumpier intus: they
come from without and they are too in themselves good and salutary;
therefore it is the vas ipsum alone that is in fault, and not the things
which come into it: thus the heart of inan is to blame, not what nature
gives to it: the copula et adds much to the force of the antithesis. 20
flumem which means loose, falling to pieces and the like, applied to an
earthen vessel can hardly have any other sense than leaky: 111 1009
laticem pertusum conyerere in vas, Quod tamen escpleri nulla ratione

‘nt possis plus aut minus addere, vere: on intus see n. to 111 171: there
and 1 223, 11 711 and 1v 1091 ‘intus has its proper force3 though here to
join intus with receperat would be the more natural collocation of the
words; and even Lamb.‚ though he suggests the punctuation which
Lach. and I have adopted, adds ‘aut intus pro intro accipiendum quod
huic scriptori non esse inusitatum iam ante admonuimus’: Ovid met. x
457 Iamque fores aperit, iam ducitur intus, intus must surely=intr03
yet Quintil. 1 5 50 says pointedly ‘eo tamen intus et intro sum soloecis·
nii sunt', and before him Lucilius lx ‘Intro nos vocat ad sese, tenet
intus apud se '.

tum scindunt hominem cuppedinis acres Sollicitum curae quantique perinde
timores: Epic. Diog. x 142 says more harshly εἰ τὰ ποιητικὰ τῶν περὶ τοὺς
ἀσώτους ἡδονῶν ἔλυε τοὺς φόβους τῆς διανοίας τούς τε περὶ μετεώρων καὶ
θανάτου καὶ ἀλγηδόνων, ἔτι τε τό πέρας τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν ἐδίδασκεν, οὐκ ἅν ποτ’

κ.τ.λ.; Hor. epist. 1 16 65 qui cupiet, metuet quoque: Seneca has many
similar commonplaces. 25 finem within which they may be indulged 3
