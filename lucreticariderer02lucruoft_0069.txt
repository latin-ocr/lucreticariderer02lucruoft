Caecaque materies caelum peifecit et orbem, of the epicurean atoms.
yerit res: the metaphor is taken from the government of a state: res
yeruntur, yeri res and the like occur frequently in Lucr. always more or
less with the same force: comp. Cic. de nat. deor. 11 82 where the stoic
Balbus says nos cum dicimus natura constare administrarique mundum.
329—369: but there is void as well as body in things, else there
could be no motion, no birth, no growth: the hardest things can be
penetrated ,· and therefore have void in them: again things of equal size
are not all of equal weight, only because one contains more or less void
than another. 329 the whole universe of things is not solid dense
body 3 there is also void in things. corporea naturazcorpore, as animi
natura, mundi natarazanirnus, mundus, etc. stipata, a favourite
word to express what is close packed, pressed, rammed together: Wak.

his most general term for void, used as a subst.; the τὸ κενόν of the
Greeks: he also uses vacuum, vacuum inane, inane vacansque and the
like: spatium, omne quod est spatium, vacuum spatium, locus, locus ac
spatium and the like express space in its extension, wherein things are
and through which atoms move,=><u5pa, τόπος; it is intactile or manet
intactum 3 σῖναφής φύσις, as it is defined by Epicurus. 331 Quod cog]-
nosse=a nomin. subst. as shewn by N ec sinet: this use of the infin. is
common in Lucr. as 111 67, 354, 731, IV 765, 836 foll. 843 foll. v 979,
1118, 1250, 1297 foll. 1379, 1406, 1407, VI 380, 415, 416: Lucr. also
uses the infin. for an accus. subst.: see n. to 418. 332 quaerere, as 11
10 ‘m'am palantis quaerere m'tae ; and our ‘to be to seek'. 333 summa
rerum, properly the whole sum, universe of things, while baec rerum
summa is this our single world, as explained in n. to 2353 comp. n. to
1008 on rer. sum. 334: see notes 1: I cannot conceive this v. to be
genuine, it may have been interpolated by some one who did not see
that 335, as well as 331, referred back to 330. 336 officium, Officere:
one of his favourite plays on words, united with alliteration obstare . .
, omni...0mnibus 3 on which comp. what is said above p. 15: the words
are simple homonymes, as in Cic. pro Sex. Rosc. 112 cur milei te offers
ao meis commodis officio simulato officis et obstas. 340 subl. caeli: see
n. to 315. sublima: Enn. trag. 5 seems to have sublimas, and Accius

limi aetheris, and the antiquarian Apuleius met. IV 23 sublimis volatibus.
[So Lucil. vl11 1 has yracila 3 see Mueller's note] Lucr. uses more than
once the adv. sublime, but never the adj. sublimis: 11 845 sterila: 11
