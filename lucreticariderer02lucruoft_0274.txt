Pseud. 385 Ad eam rem usust hominem astutum doctum scitum et calli-
dum3 [and Amph. 501, where see Ussing 2] or facere may be supplied:
for Lucr. 1268 Nec molles opu' sarit motus, like other writers, uses the
plur. verb with a nom. plur. 832 inter quaec. precantur: see n.
to 1 452. 836 ridere, 837 orare, 843 conferre, 844 lacerare, foedare,
848 mandare, 850 sedare allznom. subst.: see n. to 1 331. 841 sbret
usus: usus has here of course its ordinary sense: soret usus above with
the meaning offeret opus seems to have suggested to him the use of the
words here in another sense: comp. 1 875 latitandi...laticare, and n.
there. 843 Aa contra cet.: Arist. de part. anim. 1 5 and 1v 10 goes
over much the same ground as Lucr. here, and comes to exactly opposite
conclusions: he uses the tools made by a man as a proof that the tools
made by nature had the same end in view, the hand being ὦσπερεὶ
ὄργανον πρὸ ὄργάνωνε the body and all its parts are made for the
functions they perform, as the saw is made for the sake of sawing: the
sawing is not done for the sake of the saw. conferre manu cert. puy:

41: Aen. 11 443 clipeosque ad tela sinistris I'rotecli obiciunt. 852 em
usu vitaque seems to be the same as ea: usu vitae. 856 procul est ut
credere possis seems on the analogy of prope est πη but I know no
parallel: haud or non procul esse quin is the usual expression.
858—876: the body requires food, because it loses many particles
constantly, and thus an aclling void is produced, which has to be filled
up and the pain allayed 3 liquid too is taken into the body and quenches
the particles of heat in the stomach; thus both thirst and hunger are
appeased.—These vss. too, as Lach. p. 259 shews, are well adapted to the
general subject of 1v, but here interrupt the connexion of the argument
and are manifestly an after-thought of the poet's. 860 fluere cet.: 11
1128 N am cerceflufere adque recedere corpora rebus Multa manus dandum
est: this with what precedes and follows is what the poet refers to in
docui, together with perhaps 1v 218—229: 1v 695 Nam peoiicusfhaeere
atque recedere rebus odores. 865 icitur in the apodosis: see n. to 1
419. 866 subruitur, 867 suffulciat belong to the same metaphor, the
shoring up a falling structure: Hor. sat. 11 3 153 ni cibus atque I‘nqens
accedit stomaclioficltura ruenti: comp. 11 1140 fulcire cibus and n. there:
Lucr. speaking of the causes of sleep says IV 942 F it quasi paulatim
nobis per membra ruina, and then 950 Et quoniam non est quasi quod
sziffulciat artus. 868 interciatus: 227 interdatur: see n. to 716. pa-
tentem, 869 opturet are also the same metaphor. 869 amorem edendi,
